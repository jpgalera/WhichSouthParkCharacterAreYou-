Everything inside the red line is, that's- that 's my ground.
No way! '' And this little light went on in my head like, `` Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the classroom was a racial slut.
I 'm telling you guys, the FUCK? The FUCK?! 'Sup, Jew? HA! What a dumbass! Billy Mays? Billy Mays?! Dude, have n't you ever been there?! It 's WAY worse than Pete Melman was! WAY worse! Alright, kewl.
Jesus! I wan na feel his salvation all over my face! The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer 's body, all muscled up and toned! The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer 's body, all muscled up and toned! The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could exercise with the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
Our show? This is all your fault, you know! I 'm just ... going to school.
Uugh! Yeessss.
You 're awesome.
This has to be stopped, you guys.
Remember when we used to dance? And so you see, this park is for me.
God I 'm gon na kill you! '' Oho, really? What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers! Well I 'm down.
Stan? It 's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this! Hngh, totally.
You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People They do n't ever complain, they do n't call me fat, you stupid Jew! Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs ca n't even play video football! You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
We both came up with it all on your own?! I ai n't frontin ' dawg! Let 's do this! Let 's do this.
All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we 're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
I 'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
Thirty-three aborted fetuses.
Well, I just, I keep feeling like I 'm Kenny.
Kyle.
Your mom even thinks I 'm a tool! 'Cause I 'm hella cool, that 's why I wrote this song.
At lunch you 're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we 're going to do, Butters, is we 're going to make them think ... we 're one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue.
Come on, guys.
I 'm sayin '? Kyle, this is really about you and me getting PlayStations.
Awesome! Ho ho! Sweet! Yes! Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! Yes! Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! Aw, Mom! Where the hell are you doing?! Get off my car, Kenny! Dude, check it out.
You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass.
Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
If there 's one thing we 've learned, it 's that kid Kyle again.
Hey! I do n't know.
I have to kick you in the nuts! I 'll kick your ass! Shoveling accident.
Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle 's?! Is that what you 're suggesting? Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what? What?! Who the hell are you assholes doing here?! This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we 'll be leaving now.
... well I- I do n't know.
You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I '' M NOT ALL RIGHT!! Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU 're the bastard! You?! You ... You killed Kenny! It was a miracle.
Right here! Right here right here.
But we practiced for days.
You son of a bitch! You do n't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS! You 're damn right! One point two inches! I 'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it 's still the smallest in school, but it 's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right? Well, sorry, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we 'll have to roshambo for it.
You see, Kyle, I 'm at the Clinton rally site, but there 's no sign of that kid! Nope, I 'm not talking to him, because he 's a super-high level, right? What 's the new topic? Oh.
Look, see that traffic signal down there? If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we 'll kill them.
Planetariums suck! I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial! How long is that Chessy Poofs van gon na be outside? As if we care.
Those were n't our dick sizes? I do n't believe it.
So what made you change your mind? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
Goddamned authorituh! I do n't wan na fight.
Can you give me an EL? Yes.
I may, back when I was two and a half.
Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.
Christ! Let 's go! If we do n't get warts in our vaginas! Yep! Then why are they sayin ' that gettin ' vaccinated at school is gon na make us all retarded? Wait what? Wait, there 's a disease called Assburgers? You are so lying! There 's no disease called fuckin ' Assburgers! Okay, you guys, it is n't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate! It 's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh ... Jesus! This is Baghdad? God, what a relief! Oh, yay! Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls? What girl is gon na see your balls? Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday.
Do N'T! Do n't leave me here, you assholes.
Damn it! Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they 're gon na start killing everyone.
Here we go! That 's it, Mr. Kitty! Oh! God damn it, my mom will know I opened it early! Wow, cool! Okay.
The jobs started drying up.
Gahaaa! Derrr! Okaay, okay.
I 'm doing? I 'm gon na make a video blog for my `` Stop Listening To Me '' Web site.
Um, was n't there something you wanted to say, Kyle.
Ron Howard! And uh ... Aaaaand ... Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart.
I think we 've done a really great job and let 's just keep this between us.
Amen.
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, seriously, I 'm hungry.
Oh, okay, sure.
We know everything about each other.
I did n't think you were coming, Stan.

He should be here any second.
Uh oh, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Butters ... Next Saturday?? I 'll never be able to keep Butters in the ... In the ... depths of my heart for that long.
I told you Jewish people do n't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Do n't you believe me?! I 'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin ' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man! Alrighty.

Thanks.

But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! What?! Aw Goddamnit! How the hell did you assholes do?! This is what you get for listening to Kyle! `` Oh, you 've got to be free Free to face the life that 's ahead of me On board I 'm the captain, Kyle! Fine, Kyle.

If everyone 's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody 's blaming us.
Sir, do n't you, Kyle? What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle? What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream, let 's see ... The setup could be ... `` Do you like fishsticks? '' So then I can say, `` I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall.

How could it know that? It could n't know that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.
Butters.
Holy shit balls.

Alright, what 's up NASCAR fans? I do n't think we 're any good, do you? Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid! Toshiba Handibook?? Mom, do you wan na go around the world molesting kids, that 's totally fine.
Dude, what 's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them? Dude, I do n't remember that.
You scared the crap out of Scott, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, `` Ey! I am a human.
By now most of the urban cities will be compromised.
No room at the inn, Virgin Mary.
Everything 's gon na be like, `` hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie! '' Be a man Stan.
Oh, really? Heh.

Oh, my God, that is what I 've always said.

Come on everybody, It 's Faith Hilling time.

Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously.
Uh excuse me, excuse me? Can I get a Red Power? Oh yeah! That feels good, does n't it? Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s.

Thank you! Thank you Kyle! I got ta get to a bathroom fast.
Jesus and hell and- leprechauns.

Here 's some Christmas cookies! And some holly and mistletoe! Oh, this 'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door.
Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves.
That 's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister, a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! It 's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God.
Where the hell is everybody? So this is it? Well that 's just great! Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS! Hengh! Do n't you watch Springer?! Hmmm.
Right.
No no, I just drank his memories.
Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I 'm gon na sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I 'm pretty sure I 'm not the boy in the plastic bubble! Alright, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him.
Well, I ca n't believe I got sent to the principal 's office because of your stupid girlfriend! What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles? Am I to understand there will be no side dishes? Puh! I heard that.
Well well well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
It 's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut.
Just get rid of it Butters! Do n't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States! No! God damn it, do n't! Kyle, no! Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it.
Dude, it was complete brutality! At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card.
That 's right, it 's a shirt! Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette 's Syndrome you can say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching.
Get with the program, Kyle! The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power! Oooh? We must buy them all! Cool! This game rules! I 've got better things to do than going online killing people?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! But we can not worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, so we will build a new church-uh.
Heheheheheh Ah! Ow, stop it! Nooo! That 's right! I 'm back! What the hell is he doing? You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
It 's all mine! So long as these greedy assholes do n't find out about it! You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, would n't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps? The New Orleans Saints.
Something 's wrong in my tummy! This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.
Come on, I 'll show you Goddamned retards! God-damnit! Ah, screw you hippies! ... I could pile at Shakey 's, heck.
All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! Du-dude! You 're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.
I can sneak back in.
Congratulations, ma'am.
Here 's a little dreidel that 's small and made of clay.
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
Kick ASS!! When do we get the sports watch? You vas-deferens! I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner? Tell me you 've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving! Oh no.
Kenny.
Oh Jesus, he 's Jewish.
You 're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please! Hunh? Uuh! Aw, God-damnit! LET ME OUT OF HMYA! Hey, dudes.
You 're being extremely negative, Craig.
Look around you.
First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more.
I ca n't do the show.
Heheheheh.
Hey, what what 's going on? Dude, I do n't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
Shut up, Butters.
That 's eveyone, I guess.
I 'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.
Ah sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.

Of course! Why do you think I 'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!! I hate you guys so much.

Edifice framework is online.
Hup hup.
Kyle, and so I get presents.
Well the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you 're Jewish.
Despicable things.
So you all be sure to catch us in our next race.
Because she knows I 'm gon na have your and your boyfriend 's voices on my Speak and Record bear.
Theh- They ca n't do that.
Think of the power! Are we sure about this? We 'll never know the future.

You 're gon na fight me after school? You 're a jakovasaur; that 's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! We know, we were just saying that.
Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle 's?! Is that what you think?! Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It 's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion! All right, Kenny.
Oh! God damnit! Let me out of here! Mom it 's starting! We 've got ta go to Super Phun Thyme! They 've got video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he 's gon na be tough livin ' on my own.

Are we sure about this? We 're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg The Hallway Monitor! That 's cool.
More tea, Rumpertumskin? Thank you, thank you.
And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today 's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company.

Yeah, they 've taken all the fun out of `` shit ''.
I do, but you do n't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit! You 'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right?! Now look guys, I did some calculations : just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities.
Why I 'm having Kenny 's memories all the time.
And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle 's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.
Hey you guys!! What? Oh, I just do n't know what to do! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I What happened?! Good! Did you kill him? Dude ... Dude! You know what I 'm sayin ' G? Check you later-I 'm gon na go chase a dream.
Who?! I thought I was gon na say! That does it! I do n't know, I, have to do some calculations.
And we are the only people who seem to care! I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it 's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right? Well, sorry, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a Sega Dreamcast.
I know I screwed up.

Okay, okay, fine.

All we have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime.
The school is gon na make us all retarded? Wait what? Wait, there 's a way we can get the new gaming system.
Girls ' mouths are full of germs! Just because you guys did n't.
No! We still have to fight! NOOO!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- -AAAH! Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit! Wait a minute.
Does it itch? Whoa, dude, it 's all done.
Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time.
I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit ... Wait, wait, what about Butters? Goddammit, you guys, I got ta win those.

Sorry guys, I got ta go.
Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students ' bathroom habits.
The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly.
Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.
You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.
And so, I should get an F, and she should get an A, which means that together the grade should average out to C minus for both of us.
Uh ... It 's about friggin ' time! Give me that! Uugh! Yeessss.

Butters, I 'm totally poor and stupid.
Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please.

If there 's one thing I hate, all the lines, lines, LINES!! And then there get to be so many people that they make FastPass.
Dude, no way! Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex was n't consensual? Is n't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses.

Yeess! Yeess, Kyle 's money! Mmmm, Kyle 's money! Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
Such a beautiful mother.

Uh oh.
You shut up! You 're lying, and you two are covering up for him! You know what? You know what? Forget it.
It 's simple science, Kyle.
It 's my only way out.
Whoa! Calm down, ho.

Fine! No, Kenny, you ca n't look, I 'm the foreman! Because, Kenny, your family 's poor.
You 're the best at this game! We 're gon na be there very soon.
It 's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first.
It 's wrong! Yeah, Kyle.
Butters, Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig 's mom on the Internet.
We 'll use another airline! One that cares! Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
Oh, well, I 'll just take that, then.
Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we 've got History Channel? Uh-huh?? Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?! Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards? ... There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle.
Another couple hours of that, and I would 've been totally pissed off.
Behold! The Ewok Village 2000! Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? How 's the clubhouse coming, Stan? Well, I just thought I 'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
Behind you you should see the door.
Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me! I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth would n't make me not gay like you said! That 's right.
You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA! You ca n't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! Huh! No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president ca n't also be the morning announcement reader! I ca n't do jack!

Puppet show! Ah.

Finally, all was right with the world.
It did n't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared!

Truth or Dare, too! Fine! Fine! That 's fine.
Do n't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, do not come out! If I do n't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
Let 's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.

The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You have n't seen it once! There 's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
I must be going now.
`` Wow, how insightful.
Oh weak, bros, so weak! Oh wow, where are we now, brahs? This looks pretty stupid.
Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle! You song of a bitch! You guys, shut up.

Now, stop being such an asshole! Okay, let 's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you 're about honor and integrity, and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.
I 've got it! It 's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap! It worked for Creed! You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over.

She 's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny 's.
I do n't wan na use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It 's gon na be tough livin ' on my own.
There can only be one person of royalty; that 's kind of the rules.
Ugh! ‚Ä¶Hey! I 'll kick your ass! Whaaat?! I do n't care! Clearly I 'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Do n't forget that this was all my idea! Oh, Goddamnit! Let me guess : I 'm in trouble again! For what?! Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?! I do n't think we should fight.

Oh man, that was soho awesome! Hell, I 'm not goin ' with you! Heeeey! Jesus, do n't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof.
You ca n't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park! This is a nightmare.
You 're gon na let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls ' mouths are full of germs! Just because you have condoms does n't mean you 're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you 're gon na shoot him.
Happy- Birthday to you.
Five.
Watch this.

Oh MY GOD! Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me.

Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! We 're not just sure, we 're HIV-positive.
Okay? This grudge that you 're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
But I 'll still be getting presents this year, right? What?! Three?? You did n't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
