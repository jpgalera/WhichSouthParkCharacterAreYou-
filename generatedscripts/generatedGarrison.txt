Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!

In fact, I will call social services on you! Well, it sucks.
We have school tomorrow! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I What happened? You guys, look at them.

We still have plenty of money.
Alright alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
Bring it, bring it! Yeah, well, when a man has been wronged ... he no longer cares about danger.
That 's true, but, there 's an illness that makes you the most responsible.

For democracy 's sake, right Kyle? No! No, come on! You 've known I was the only one who can.
Ugh.
But why, Stan? Right, but she feels like if she does n't know how we 're gon na ask the president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is going off the air.
Because, because what? Because he wanted to be a pirate, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! But I 'm not buying the park to get people to come.

Stay away from us, bastards! We do n't have a choice.
Just give me back my cocoa! Stan, are you wearing a different hat? Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter 's chin.
Get them while they last, folks.
How about you? You 're a jakovasaur; that 's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! We know, we were just saying that.
If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right? But of course you know that, do n't you?! Oh, that was close.
Maybe it 's just a stupid little paper hat.
Come on, guys.
What is this? Halt! It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me! I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih -- -- special armor, that 's impenetrable to American bullets.
Hey, Butters.

Come on, Jack, you 're breaking my balls- I, I 'll think about it.
That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! No! No! As a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.
No stupid Kyle around.
He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.
Okay children, let 's take our seats.
Right.
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter! We 're not paying nine ninety five! All right all right, here 's what we know.
We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, but now look at this photo of the Pentagon.
That 's good, Good, all right then.
Alrighty then.
I made him up.
Are we good? Bail, bail! Okay, our mission failed, but we 've got to stick together to make this play work! All of us! Alright, got to write the new lyrics.
I found it! I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is gone, and he is n't coming back, and I do n't know why the tooth fairy 's being so cool to me.
We 're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we 're gon na have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I 'm supposed to be at work today.
Oh, oh phew! Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it is n't so funny now, is it?! Wah! Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
Aaaah! No! The bread is all flat! No! I 'm alive! Can you believe it? It 's a Web site about all the students in the school! Yeah yeah, I 'm only gon na prank-call people.

Just sign the paper and he 'll be playing ball for St. Mary 's.
You shut up, butthole.
Okay, children, well now it 's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there 's one thing I 've been teaching you? Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You 're chea-ting nature itself.
You go find chicks, Kenny.
Alrighty then.
I 'm not moving, Butters.
Better.
Oh, whatever! Ho-okay, children, we have a new student joining our class today.
Because, Kenny, your family 's poor, dude.
For that is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle 's family to get out before the storm hits.
Yeah! Come on, everybody! No way, this is so cool! Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I 'm goin ' to a better place.
The Jews took all the money away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just ca n't take it anymore! HAAAAAH! Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! Ca n't I still make up for it? Jesus Christ! I 'm just as poor an ' stupid as they fuckin ' come, so come down an ' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama 's gay as hell! You all know my pit boss, Butters.
Hehehehe.
Duuuuurrrr.
It 's Adolf Hitler costume.
Second-degree titty-twister! How the hell did you get out? Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, did n't you?! What about her huge freakin ' hooters, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle 's?! Is that what you think this is funny, you sonofabitch? Mom, this is degrading! Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! Maaaa.

Where the fuck did he go?! Haha! Game over, Butters! Go! Quick! Are you ready? This is it, Butters.
What?! Oh, here 's everybody.
What? So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it? No, that 's okay.
They 're all gon na make bank! You guys, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh hey, Butters! I 'm gon na piss in their face.
You go ahead.
You 'll get your pubes guys, someday.
There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle.
Uh uh, excuse me just a second, please, Craig.
You guys! You guys! Seriously! I 'm a star! I 'm -- Aaawww, I 'm nobody! God-damnit! Wait a minute.
Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls.
Do n't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunate! Follow me! You guys, should n't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here! We 're safe! No no, you got it?? Oh, stop it! Nooo! That 's right! Wait a minute.
Good riddance to YOU! Yep, it 's done.
And um ... what appears to be ... a penis ... in my mouth.
Papapa poker face papa poker face.
No, but you 've got ta cry, like this : `` My parents molestered me.
If you cheat and succeed, you 're savvyyy.
Choo-choo train.
There 's lots, there 's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows.
Hooray for the South! But why? Why should they get the bell? But we do n't have any cigarettes.
His dad just killed his mom.
I do n't wan na be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore.
I go to the doctor, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Do n't worry Polly Prissypants, you 're gon na kick my ass right now.
What is he still doing here?! Wow, cool! All right! The Rad Russian.
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
We 'll go to LA with your wife.
I 've got to be kidding me.
I 'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol does n't know who Wing is.
I 'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog 's murder! What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
Look Kenny! There 's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken for a dollar ninety nine.
Take a seat.
Hey! Where is it, you filthy Jew?! You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of cookies? I wan na Fudge 'Em.
Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
Okay students, let 's take a vote : Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it 's called menopause? Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that 's why Kyle 's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he 's goin ' through menopause.
He 's not dead yet! Me, too.
Is this one of your favorites? Oh, then you wo n't mind giving us a semen sample.
Hey.
Two donuts and a pack of licorice.
I guess it 's just you and me, Ms. Cartman.
... So, anyways, if you wan na steal somebody 's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
Jakovasaurs are so cool.
It will be like this forever.
That guy can kill us so easily because he 's a super-high level, right? What is her agenda? She 's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let 's ask these questions.
Really? That 's cool.
Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list.
Awesome! We should n't have this many responsibilities! We 're children! Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! That 's ... so ... cool! It 's Monday? What, dude? Come on, come on! This is ridiculous.
Is n't that it? Always the mom 's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
Three boys named Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming.
( Hey! Come over here! ) ( Hey! Help! ) No, please! I 'm sorry! Ah I 'll stop! I will Yeah.
Uh I 'll leave the door open a little in case you ... need to see me about anything.
Kenny! Hey you guys, when I 'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Just this one time.
And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.
Alright, let 's start with roll call.
Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it.
Hey, this is our party.
No, it 's not an act, Kyle! All I have to do is make it to Friday with your egg unharmed to prove what great little parents you are.
They totally think I 'm hotter than you are.
Kyle.
Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that 's what I always do, too! Yeah.
Boys, you 're too young to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power! I left my charger at home! Fine! I hate you!! Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
And I was all like, `` No way! '' And this little light went on in my head like, `` Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the classroom was a racial slut.
And so, even though I walk through the valley of death.
A child ... and a female.
I sneaked around my mom 's closet too, and saw what I 'm getting.
Hehe.
The tape is returned to which it came.
Jimmy, what are you doing?! His shield and armor spells are down! Looks like you 're the turd now! Aaaaa! Yes! I 'm the captain, so climb aboard We 'll search for tomorrow, on every shore And I 'll try, oh lord, I 'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting.
Mr. Slave! Well, give us a kiss! What the hell is that? Oh my God, this is awesome.
For God 's sake, get on with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold.
Now leave us alone!! My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile.
We 're not paying you to sit on your ass! Do n't worry about it, Butters.
Deah, eh eh.
Stan, he 'll break it.
Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses! All right, lock that door, Craig! I 've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please? Right, but you see, I did n't have parents to do it for me like you do! Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny.
Love is like taking a dump, Butters.
That 's it.
Deeper.

So then you have to be quiet.
You 're saying, `` Hey, why do I have to kick you in the nuts.
In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there 's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal.
Oh man, that 's just weak.
What are you doing with your time?! Yeah, I 'm a fuckin ' monkey!! Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.
... Wendy ... Testaburger! Hey, he 's like 50 years old! Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody 's gon na notice ''?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Do n't forget I have a signed contract from you.
Kyle, if there 's a way to find out who did this to Clyde, and I 'm exhausted.
We need to remake that list.
Haaa hahaha! You guys are such pussies! Hemmm ... No, just a bunch of black people.
Fly fly fly ... Oh fine, go on and leave! I 'm gon na crash I 'm gon na tell my mom on you.
Uhaw man, I ca n't find my mooom! Ahaha, okay okay it 's getting old.
The city needs protection.

Eric Cartman is the NSA 's worst nightmare! The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status! Ca n't do anything?? You 're the NSA! I do n't trust you.
This one, I call `` Hot Fudge Mondae ''.
We can do this the easy way, or we can just calm down because honestly, I 'm getting pissed now! God! Hey, there it is! I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song! Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow! Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling! Is n't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the time you masturbated to the men 's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?! I was beating off to the chicks! THERE WERE NO CHICKS! OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER! ADMIT IT! NO!! AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle! Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND! I 'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner 's ankle to the school flagpole.
Check it out! Awesome! Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! Yehess! I 'm so happy! I 'm so fucking bored! We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
Oh it 's sooo easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis! What? Holy Freaking Jesus.
So everything worked out.
You know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that 's happened to this town in a long time, Kyle.
God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking, `` Poopypants Pete '', but th- but then I also thought of `` Mushpants Melman.
Very well, thank you.
Uh-oh.
Fight! Right now! We 're moving on to Civil War history.
Oh really? Then, why do n't you hold it? Well, God is gon na kill little Egyptian boys.
Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need- Refugees from Syria should be considered in need- Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
Go ahead dude.
Look at this place! Do n't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me! They did n't take my Stormtrooper watch ... My Arkham City game is still here ... what else could they have- Oh my God.
She 's back! Would you like tuh ... head over to my place for dessert? Oh yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks.
Now, sir, is there some kind of a ... Okay, okay, fine.
Please excuse my tiny crutch; it 's the only way you ever really lose.
Bitch, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me! Now hand it over! You ca n't do that, Eric! You have to get out of here.
Uh, let me try.
When Kyle said that humans were n't the only species that can have light skin and freckles.
I am the official messenger boy, I am.
Stand back! I ... am going ... to Casa ... Bonita! Ah! Eh.
Of course! Why do you have a problem.
I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I 'll do what I waunt! Oh yeah?! Well, well, well, look who 's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!

Guinea rats? What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, Mr. Twig.
Time for me to give it up.
With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size! You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, do n't you? You really believe in me.
Have you ever met my friend Kyle 's mom? She 's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world She a stupid bitch, if there ever was a bitch, she 's a bitch, on Tuesday she 's a bitch to all the boys out there, okay? Oh what a perfect night for fighting.

I sneaked around my mom 's closet too, and saw what I 'm getting.
You kick ass! I do n't think I 'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool.

Wait! No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I 've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I wan na fingerpaint, then I 'm gon na fingerpaint! '' Totally.
And Wendy, I 'm still going to stick with you.
I 'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT! What? Hello? Yeah yeah no, false alarm again.
Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.
Let 's roll cameras.
Calm down, Kenny! Do n't get your plague germs on me! But ... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right? I knew it! You guys, it 's really the best Christian album that 's ever been produced, actually.. I think that 's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
Could it be I ... only lost the race because I somehow was n't poor enough? Get me my coat, Butters.
Shut UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! What? Haha, very funny.
I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? It does n't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, that is adorable.
They were your FRIENDS! Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we 're gon na need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters.
Ms. Lopez.
Pussy.
Haha! Game over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care! I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it 's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.

Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! No! Hold on a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?! I 'm not your buddy! And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly ... Yes, that 's true, but, let 's face it : they ca n't wrestle for crap! I mean, the way they always talk about `` protectin ' the earth '' and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wan na go home!

There, that 's better.
So how are things, Kyle? And you feel like you have to confess.
