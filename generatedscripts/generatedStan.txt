Hello, did you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes? Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he walks with a limp.
You 've got ta wade through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then they try to get proof of this thing.
Looks like nobody will ever know.

I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt! Jeez, we 're out of work too! Oh, huh.
But today, we do something about it.
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face? How can I trust you? How can I trust you? How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.
Feels good to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
We just have to try another day.
Wuh, where do people keep TV sets? '' and then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
That 's all we had to do it.
Ca n't you see I 'm in horrible pain?! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls? Exactly how long are we going to do.
We have to go to that hospital where they 're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap.
Let me see that.
Butters.
You can just suck my balls! No! Hold on a second : making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy! Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too! How does this thing work, Cartman? Okay, that does it! Screw you guys, I 'm going in the right direction here.
Dude, I 'm telling you that I 'm gon na have to deal with the Dawg! Hall infraction! You got a hall pass, brah! I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face.
I 'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! Goddamnit, what the fuck? Profile? I 'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I 'm gon na have your fuckin ' balls! Fly to Christ.

Princess Kenny.
Well yeah.
Why ca n't I behave myself? Oh Jesus! Dad, I 'm just like you guys.
I think Butters would want us to go.
It 's just this case, and ... the guys down at the station, I ... I ... 'm making this all up! Uh, I ... I have some things I really need to talk to you.
Do you have them or not?! THERE IS NO CHRIST! No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters? Sh! You hear that everyone? I 'm gay! I 'm gay! I 'm not doing it! No, I do n't understand this game at all.
Okay, okay, wait, here we go.
And that 's how the relationship with my father sort of ended.
They do n't just allow them, they have them available at the front.
Thank you very much, Billy.
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet : `` Rowr, rowr, I 'm scary Grandma! '' It was n't me.
Why are all my mature adult friends being `` mys-teriously '' arrested, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here! I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Is n't that right, Fartboy? Are you sure, Fartboy? I 've had a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? Brother Kyle? Why do you do these things to me? You talkin ' to me? I do n't get it.
White people in here working for the Chinese.

With all his jokes about Cartman being poor.
Well yeah, sure.
Eric is right.
Buh-ters! Testicles and scrotum! Uh oh, I have a note for you.

Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it, you filthy Jew?! You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of pirates are you?! How many people 's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy! Great, I love crapping in a toilet with no rim on it.
Well, looks like at least you 've got some too.
No, and fuck Kyle! Yeah, dude, eh, that 's why he sent me here; 'cause he 's too embarrassed to come himself.
Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin ' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday? Come on in, Craig.

You guys are blind! I ca n't stand it! Mom, Dad! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, right? Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides.

Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid? Aww, you guys.
We 've got ta get to my balls before Kyle hurts himself! We do n't have anything! It is really sweet.
Forward, men! That, no- No, you- You 've got ta turn me.
They tried to bring it back recently, but it did n't work.
Feeling faint.
When Token sees that, maybe he 'll think we 're legit.
It 's not the show we care about.
Uh huh.
Let 's punch this baby.
I get ten buck from each of you, that 's like $ 2000.
The next zipline? What are you talking about?! Sick dude, she 's my sister.
Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home? Alright, they 're gone! The Cartman store is open! Two donuts and a pack of licorice.
God-damnit! This is n't even GOOD chocolate milk mix! Egh, because they 're poor, Kyle! Poor people do n't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Do n't you watch Springer?! Hmmm.
What?? Hey, dudes.
Dude, we 're like the coolest kids in the whole state! Yeah, Butters.
I keep mine to myself, oh? Hooray! Yes.
No, just a bunch of goo.
I really owe you one.
If there 's one thing I hate, all the lines, lines, lines, LINES! If there 's one thing I 've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is! Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! We 're fine, thanks.
Now you all think I 'm a fahahahahahag.
I 'm not going to Heck, Butters! I 'm ... going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
Why?! Giya! Shut up, hippies! I 'll kill you! Do n't talk about my mom like that! Ah, I ca n't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Is n't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it 's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Why do n't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much? Uh yeah, ah I think so.
And now they 're gon na bring another kid into the world.
But I saw him! Just as plain as I 'm seein ' you right now! Ruh, really? So ... so it was just ... it was ... just my ima ... magination then? Huh s-s-super-AIDS? AAAH! Oh Jesus.
Not getting busted always is, Butters.
With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry! No, it 's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast! Look, the tooth fairy thing did n't work, the boy band thing did n't last, so I tried this route.
You just hit each other, smack each other around.
I see him.
We 're losing men fast out here! No, Cartman.
No.
Bye, Wendy.
Nnnaaargh! Really? Thank you.
We 're all gon na go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Eat my underwear? Okay.
Because they do n't fucking care! I 've told you this! They do n't give a crap about Smurfs! Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! I really do n't have a babysitter.
Coma ... How long? Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap! I ca n't reach the freezer! God damnit! Shut up, Kitty! Any problems, contact Eric 's Mommy at 303 ... Aha! I 'm gon na e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages! I seriously feel like I 'm being spied on right now.
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this? Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
O-o-o-o-h, it 's sticky.
As you can see ... Yes, what is it? Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person.
'' Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! Oh, hey, What 's goin ' on, guys? Oh-kay.
It 's the succubus! What? What happened? You guys, it 's six in the morning, I have to get across the border.
Thought it would only affect the poor.
Kenny, I called it shotgun! Dammit, Kenny, get in the back! Hey, Kenny, there 's a sale on orange jackets over there.
We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world.
All right, let 's try over here.
Alright.
Come on, you guys.
They 'll probably give me an Emmy.
You can just ... you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin ' a ball around, or you can sit at your computer and do somethin ' that matters.
Dude, why are you taking Tweek 's underpants? Business? Wait, do you know anything about business? Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us? Damn, dude, this place is huge! I do n't get it dude, w-what 's so controversial about this? All he 's done is said `` shit '' and `` fuck '' a few times.
Hang on, I 'm gon na be on TV tonight.
Can you see anything? It 's starting, it 's starting! Juuhachi desu ka? Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.
I ask you guys a difficult question? Alright.
... hm'ere.
Jesus is Lord.
Uh.
Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! `` For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.. '' Okay, okay, wait, here we go.
We 're trapped! We 've got ta get out of here! Now! Kyle! Kyle! Huho! We sure are.
No.
Naturally.
Wow, cool! Mr. Garrison, can I ask you guys a difficult question? Alright.
I 'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that 's final.
Man, that 's crap.
Okay.
Stand my ground? Yes yes, that 's what I 've been saying all along, you guys.
Yeah.
Does n't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little? That is n't true! Okay, that 's enough fatass jokes for this week.
Bohogh, egh.
That 's it? I know what 's gon na happen, Mom.
Why the hell not?! You WHAT?! Oh you! You 're comin ' with me! Butters, let go God-damn it! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee! Oh here, Kyle, you wan na play me next? They ca n't do that! Do n't you see? Think about it! It 's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! Well, looks like you 're back for good, huh Kyle? We just ca n't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat! Ah, that 's better.
No, Towelie, the entry code! God-damnit, I guess we 're even now.
Hip hip.
Ohmigod, I 'm not gon na vote and you can all just live with it! The whole thing is a joke! B-bani-banishment? You-you 're all joking, right? I 'm not voting! I just think this whole thing is a setup! That 's right! Wait a minute! Are n't you Jewish, Kyle? Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We 're gon na watch Terrance and Phillip.
And the next time you wan na shove me, just remember, I 'm covering your ass! What? What does that have to do with me? Kenny has no idea what you 're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I 'm gon na show this picture to my mom when she gets home! You 're never gon na get that list from the girls.
You can all kiss my ass! Yeah? He-hey, that 's my money! What?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family 's poor!!! I do n't wan na have to say this, but I think maybe we 're not seeing heaven because one of us does n't believe in it enough.
I can handle all this fame.
No! Screw this! You know what? You 're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you 're a Jew, Kyle.
No! Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she 's so cool all of a sudden? We should- Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! Say, Terrance, let 's look for treasuh.
Hey kid, you 're pretty good.
... just keep a lookout, I 'll try it here.
That 's it! I do n't get it.
He is so cool.
What was I supposed to do? Waaahaa! Hold on! Hold on a second! Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us! Eric, what are you doing? It 's okay Dad, I 'll take care of it.
Honey Boo Boo 's heart gave out.
Waitwaitwait, maybe that 's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
God is gon na kill little Egyptian boys.
For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen.
But it turns out Kyle was right : there are other animals that can be ginger as well I did n't believe it.
You 're not the tooth fairy! I 'll see you later! Aw, man, this is gon na be awesome.
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.
But if you 're d-dead, how come I can see you? HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Well I think ... I 'm like the kid in that movie! I-I 'm seeing dead people! Me! I saw a ghost! But I saw him! Just as plain as I 'm seein ' you right now! Ruh, really? So ... so it was just ... it was ... just my ima ... magination then? Huh s-s-super-AIDS? AAAH! Oh Jesus.
I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I do n't know if we 're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we 're turning into, but unless you ask why, we 're gon na need some video cameras.
Yeah, we like the track, yup.
You do n't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
Haaa, it 's Christina Aguilera again! She 's on my back! Hah! You 'll be inside of me ... Huh? Oh no! Agh! Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
All right, they finally came for us.
Wuh, that smells.
You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch! You do n't owe me anything.
I 'm gon na have your fuckin ' balls! Fly to Christ.
They ca n't do that! Because that 's what we 're doing! You scram! We were here first! You woke him up! Who 's the Boss? Uuh, yeah.
We 're gon na lose! Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or is n't she?! She 's got Colonel! Oh boy! Some extra-crispy thighs, extra crispy? Come on guys.
Beat it! Ow.
Yeah, listen, I 'm running a retail business, but I ca n't get enough of people 's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I 'd like to buy some of yours.
Oh, doctor.
Tell, and, everyone 's gon na laugh at meeee.
Wow dude, your dad 's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Go away, Pip! I do n't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy 's leading the other side.
Dad is in it.
Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
Hey, what the hell 's going on? Mephesto 's been shot.
Oh my God.
But I 've been livin ' it up ever since, havin ' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power! You know, the strange thing is, I have n't gotten my period yet?! Did you hear that? He 's shuffling his deck already.
Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! Rawrrrrr! Okay, there.
I do n't know.
Mr. Garrison, there 's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus! Alright, dude.
Well, I saved you all the chicken part.
Nothin ' Na- Due-nothing.
But I did n't write the note! Shut up, Cartman! Whoa! You can say that again.
I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
What? How do you know?! All right, let 's be partners, dude.
We 're here! Casa Bonita! Aw man, this is gon na be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever! Guys, I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
Right now.
Did I what? Oh my God, let me see! Oh boy! I 'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! Mom, Dad! I changed back! Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin ' a hot dog and it tasted good.
Waagh! Now wees hases it! It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
And then ... Dude, Craig, what 's goin ' on? Mother wo n't hear the truth! He says you did n't molest him as a child! Ah-I did n't! You knew I did n't! No! I did n't know! I 'm not friends with him.
All right.
Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
Un, I do n't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
I'mo drag home myself, babih.
Sure.
Got ta be strong.
See? He 's tattling again.
Well well well well well! Well well well well well! Well well well well well! Well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
No no, he 's trapped in Cartman 's body.
You guys! You guys, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do! Oh it 's sooo easy for you, is n't it, Kyle.
No! That darn device is nothin ' but trouble! Ah I 'm done, and I 'm goin ' home.
And you know what else? Screw you guys.
Go away.
Dude, there 's Cartman.
Shut up, Butters! Hand me the modeling glue.
Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone! Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Can you stack McNuggets ' deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets ' deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets ' deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets ' deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets ' deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets ' deck with more mana?! What did he play? Did he tap all his mana? Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! Wait a minute.
It 's me, Stan Marsh.
That 's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass! All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay! Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my money ... Gim me my ten dollars, Scott! Hello, sir, my name is Kris Kristofferson.
Yes.
Yeah dude.
No, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross.
You mean, like Kenny? Damn.
You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? God-damnit! You ca n't fall asleep.
Oh crap, we 've got ta hurry and give this money to Chef! Wait! Wait! What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on? This is ridiculous! What the hell are they doing now? Look, we 're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? Look, we 're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? Look, we 're not going in there, so just knock it off! What are you gloating about? What 's the matter, Kyle? Your turn, Bebe.
Oh, you can walk there.
Wait a minute.
Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
Oh, thank you Eric.
& gt; Update Profile.
Oh, I did n't want all that sweet stuff.
Butters Stotch.
I had a poofy pie in that desk! Eheh.
For one tooth.
You guys, we just wan na let you know.
I just like it.
Huh? Get the fuck out of here! Get him out! We 're done with betrayal! It 's time to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
Because I 'm hardcore.
Comprende? `` The Old Mand Y La Mer ''.
Well yeah, but ... we usually win.
Shhh! What 's that? You guys do n't need to be watching that stuff.
No.
You 're not doing the morning announcements anymore? Okay Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
Lookin ' a little better now.
Hell sent to suck the life out of a man.
What 's sarcasm and what 's com? DAD! Hey Dad! My wiener is all stiff and pointy! Thanks, Dad.
Whoa, dude, it 's all yours.
It 's time for equality.
I 'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
Bad economy made things worse.
This is the sweetest thing I 've ever done! Look at how the crap ... is sittin ' right in the middle! Okay, hokay, I 'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks! I 'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
That 's me! And so them my friend started hollerin ' at me, sayin ' `` you took my rubber bands.
I should 've done a long time ago.
Stanground is bigger than me! You wan na tell me what 's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man 's face?! No! No! They 're gon na murder you.
Do n't stress about it or you just might faint.
They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
Fine! Then maybe I 'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! Dwaah!! I 've done it, General Disarray.
You 're not ugly.
Yep.
We know how the trade works : why do n't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit? Oh, what the hell is this?! All right, let 's go win! Huh? Sso then we win? Hey.
Who are you? I am you.
'night, Government.
Whites win! Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again! No! Dude! No fucking way! Dude! Stop! Stop! Noooo!!! Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works : why do n't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit? Oh, what the hell is goin ' on in this cartoon? Oh.
How does it go? To Grandmother 's house we go Argh! I guess, damn! We do n't care, Mom.
Who 's that? What? We have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We 're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! No, we got ta run away somewhere warm.
You 're goin ' with Christ! ... And that 's what I got, Principal brah.
Sure, dude.
All right guys, come on.
I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I 'm sorry, but I 'm not! Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody 's gon na show up! Look at it, dude.
Your dad has a fucking drone? Whooaa! You wan na take it out for a spin? Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you do n't understand how important list-making is to girls! It 's just not something we do flippantly! There 's protocol! All right, I 'll stay with Kenny.
Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass.
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it 's right over there.
This picture you may find somewhat ... controversial.
Muh uh, 'cause I 'll tell my mom on you.
Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
Gooh.
That 's good.
It 's diet, dude.
We were n't in the commercial, remember? Oh all right.
Come on dude, it 's pretty funny! I would n't care.
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play! No, that 's right.
Fine! We 'll see you back here tomorrow! Damn it! Hooray! Okay, the time has finally come.
What 's wrong with me? Ugh.
I was depressed before, and now I found meaning! Neither did I! Do n't you care that I 'm depressed?! What if I become suicidal, or, or become an alcoholic like Grandpa?? ... well but ... but that 's my money.
You guys, do n't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton? But the idea that we 'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender! Hey Jessie, hey Kal.
Let me get my coat.
Did you hear that? I 'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now.
Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
Stan! Stan, I 'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?! Because if you are, it 's not cool! Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I 'm the one who 's wearing a headset and has forgotten he 's in virtual reality! Oh it 's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I 'm the one trapped in virtual reality.
Make no mistake : ginger kids are evil.
Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?! Fuck! Or if I did? What? Hello? Dude.
Uh ... I like small businesses.
Wait a minute.
Dude, do n't be nervous.
Ha haa, ha ha ha bluh oh, ha-ow! Yeah.
Craig is just being a dick because we 're having a tough time right now.
Put them there by the door.
But now it 's gotten really bad.
Seriouslih.
Mr. Worf! Wait a minute.
Darkness has taken over our town.
Oh, that 's perfect.
Aw crap! Hey, uh, I need to ask you a big favor.
Dicktits! Shit! Asshole! 'Scuse me.
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say? I do.
Will you get off my back?! It 's hard enough I got ta work the beat, and now I got ta come home to your nagging?! Look look, I 'm I 'm here for you.
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde 's uncle.
And get some more cookies and coffee! We 're not paying you to sit on your ass! Do n't worry, I have that covered.
Look! Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal.
I am legally a woman now! If you wan na be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are! Once you take a stand on something, you 're pretending like your company is about more than money.
I 'm pretty confused alright.
Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave? Okay, let 's take a vote : Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it 's called menopause? Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that 's why Kyle 's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he 's goin ' through menopause.
I do n't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii! No ... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! This is terrible.
Yeah, whatever.
So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! Sister Anne is a blasphemer! Uh-oh.
Oh.
Alright, let 's see who our first chat partner is.
Noooo! AAAAH!! Oh ... God-damnit, I have to get across the border.
Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice? Who are the corporations? Are you serious? We never heard that.
Eric.
Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, I 'm gon na need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.
That 's why he smote those sodomies in France.
But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
Everyone 's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally! Yeah! There is even gon na be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gon na tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it 's top secret! You guys gon na update your blogs too? Dude, I really ca n't hear you Lawrence.
I 'm afraid you 're never going to know.
Hwaaaahh! Mom, Mom, I got ta tell you somethin '! Being from a low-income household is n't funny! Oh heell no, my momma 's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?! How?! Dude, my momma 's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?! How?! Dude, my momma 's so poor when she gets mad she ca n't afford to fly off the handle so she 's got ta go Greyhound off the handle! Jesus, this is a long drive.
Butters? Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he 's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich? It 's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
Excuse me! There 's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They 've got a marina with boats just sitting there! We can take a boat, you guys! We have to find this address.
And this is exactly what Kenny would do : stand here and say nothing! There 's a way! There 's a way! There 's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I 'm gon na find out who did this to Clyde, and I 'm gon na do whatever I can ... to get that episode pulled.
You do n't think you 're a joke.
Well of course Stanley, what is it? What is it for? It 's upside down.
T-heh heh heh heh.
This is n't getting us anywhere! Yeah ... Or you.
I 'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants! Well, I 'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag.
I 'll try.
Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?! No.
Let 's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay? Okay children, let 's take our seats.
Yeah, I 've been working this beat for about three days now.
We can save the town and be super-rich! Well, this is it, Butters.
It 's being kept confidential! There 's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?! The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they 're dead now! We 're moving on to Civil War history.
I will Big Gay Al, I will.
If I 'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you 're nothing but a computer program! That 's right! Wait a minute! Are n't you Jewish, Kyle? ( voice rising ) Dude, Jewish people do n't celebrate Christmas.
God!!! Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon fr√®re! How the hell did you get out? Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, did n't you?! What about my dream?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! I 'M SO PISSED OFF! Ey! You used to work for me! Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks! It 's not fair, Dad! Why ca n't I be in a boy band? Dad, Cartman said we 're gon na get drowned.
Alright, let 's try to watch the language; there 's children present heuh.
They 've killed Kenny! Hey look, I think Kenny 's okay.
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
Butters this time? Dude, how is putting Butters ' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I 'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.
Ahhh- I 'm troubled, I 'm troubled in mind.
Cartman.
I was getting to that, if you will let me.
Yeah well, I wan na talk to the audience.
Huh? Oh, it 's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?! Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000! I do! I do care! Look how much.
Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls! But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they wo n't understand that I ca n't control it.
Craig 's here, too.
Man, these calves smell like crap! I do n't see any ... Oh wait.
Wwhat? You ... you ca n't.
Gon na make it right, girl, I 've got to get to Black Bart 's Cave! Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart 's Cave! Oh! Oh, I 'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O.
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose.
Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too.
Who are you gon na give this to? I-I mean, vampires ca n't eat people food.
You what?? Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.
What 's that? Alright, alright, but you guys got ta see Funnybot in Hangover 3.
Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you 're eating Chipotle.
I 'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out? But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman.
Come on, Dad.
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
Ugh.
What?? Dude, you ca n't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing- No! No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
The Passion then go see it.
Well go ahead and go.
They loved it! They LOVED it! That 's it, now down.
I call you back? Our company accountant needs me.
We tricked her and it was n't nice! It ai n't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! You killed her! Mm-my cousin 's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat urine, can you? Yeah, this is not gon na work.
It 's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on! That 's a pretty weird bone disease.
I 'm back in your room! Suppornity window dropped.
Well, he kept accusin ' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
It 's over! It 's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we 've got ... Butters! Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers! Where is Butters? All right men, rally up! There 's still a Mexican out there and he ai n't gettin ' through! You have n't won yet! Game on! You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?!

Simple thank you will suffice.
Hey, this is all of ours.

Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school.
Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.
You told me you were going to make me into a woman! Yeah?! Well there 's an old Hindu saying : `` Whoever smelt it, dealt it! '' YOU are the scums of the earth!

If I do n't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life! I ca n't let you do that, Kyle.
I 'm saying I 'm sorry.
What the hell 's wrong with him? Uh huh.
Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies.
