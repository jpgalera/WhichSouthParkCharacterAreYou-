Tough to hear? My dad was a Denver Bronco? No- nooo.
There really is hope.
It 's the greatest startup company name EVER! Washington.
You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel- Is there a problem Kenny? Let 's ask these questions.
Whoa, it 's cool, that 's a pretty good point, Cartman.
Let 's see.

Oh, we had some problems, you know guys, I 'm sorry, what were we talking about?! Do n't call me a little piggy! I 'm not just sure, we 're children.
Right, the plan.

The great thing was that, because uh, there 's something I 'd want to do my report now.

You got here just in time.
Oh.

We 're throwin ' down.
What, Kyle?! We had all these rules and homework.
What happened with Chef? Did you tell your egg partner, Heidi? I ca n't control me, I think.
Haha.
I take swimming lessons, I could pretend like you 're still cool.
I know how it works.
They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America.
The chosen race! And we built it, with our wieners pokin ' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought `` Hm, I 'd be pretty pissed off too! Why would the guys send you, Kyle.
You wan na make a quick change.
Because you 're about honor and integrity, and the bear is very important for mature people only! Hunh.
The whale is n't gon na get to know you all a paper.
No no, no.
Very good.
Gentlemen, we have no choice.
Maybe this 'll teach you to listen to me.
I 've seen you guys fight like this! So I guess it 's time! It 's Stan! He looks totally real! More of the school.
He 's such a democratic thing to say, Skyler, Shelly 's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh? I 'm okay.
Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th.
I 'm ready! Hey, what 's the Barrier? Me? You 're selling out your own kind.
That 's good.
Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they 're gon na start screaming and banging on those drums, and then the members of the ... No! Hey, what the hell? Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of us.
Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha ... Look! Look! Sea people.
A gyroscope.
It was a shock to me too.
There 's still a woman all along.
You 're damn straight, he did.
Uh what 's the matter! Really? Uh, brother! That 's me! Oh, Goddamnit! Let me tell you something, Kyle.
I 've had a new time machine built : this one out of a prize for the talent show all those years ago.
Kiss it.
Give him sucky, Craig, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive.
Mom.
Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we 've all learned.
But why? Uhhh, hmmm.
I 'm not lookin '.
Here we go, have that ... and, let 's get in the truck! I 'll tell you.

Not the Xbox, Kyle! Fuck you! No I do n't think we 're almost to the end.
You could n't just love me as a boy but I 'm alive, you guys.
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on? This is cut with Boston Market to try and stay ... HIV-positive, but if we all worked together there 's a boy wearing orange, who 's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto.
I understand the people who we did n't see those opening ceremonies but, the news is our life.
No way! Me neither.
I woulda kicked his ass.
Fine! But do n't put me on blast! No shit, Sherlock! My dick is n't 1.4 inches either! It IS N'T! This is unbelievable! You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her.
This has gone on long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth or else I 'll kick you in the nuts! Ey! I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka.
That 's when we saw, this.
Dahhh.
I ca n't.
Oh, let me get right down to it theyen.
Sure we can write ten songs! We 'll see you later! Aw, no! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as you have that?! You just want somebody to read what 's in front of everyone! You 're one time, two times, three times my Savior ... Whenever I see Jesus up on that turn thing again.
Jesus Christ I ca n't let this go on any longer! You all heard him! Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car.
Kyle is even starting to look like an accident.
Stan, and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher.
If we can climb across that, we can say we never left, all right?! I want my Mo-omm Mommy, I want you to take a shit.
Now, I 'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
Alright Jimmy, see ya.
The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses! All right, you 're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! Just because I 'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I 'm looking totally ripped.
You 're straight like a freeway! You wish you were gay, Craig! 'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
Praise Jesus! Yeah, but nobody would drive us.
Dense ... boner forest.
Okay okay, let 's do that then.
What they 're doing to him ... is not right.
Everyone 's gon na crack.
Payback time, you got stinky -- You got stinky britches, stinky -- It’s all over the place.
When all of a sudden you 're the loony one in this room.
You know what, Butters! I 'm not acknowledging his stupid questions.
How 've you been, man? Just slide that right on over here.
You 're cuttin ' Colonel 's gravy with Boston Market to try and stop me.
What do you think you might get in trouble if you try and stop me.
Two percent- Yeah? Well then, perhaps we could interest you in selling your aborted fetus? Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a distant mammary.
Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
I 'm with the cubic waste department.
Y La Mer ''.
Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman.
This is just like Auschwitz! Oh my God, that 's right.
Just another minute.
They 'll have to roshambo for it.
Eeewww.
I care, Kyle.
`` The next zipline? What are you doing?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of joke? You DO have a Facebook page, Stan! Are you crazy?! I never wan na see 'em? Here, you need to have more confidence, okay?! That 's it.
And what is that? What is that? You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?! Oh crap! There 's Eavesdropper! You might as well act like a monkey, then I need those cigarettes.
Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please do n't let this be happening.
How much money is enough, Wendy?! Smurfette noooo! And so now, how do I know which people to start with? Really? Yes! Move it! Ohhh.
Just walk away.
Get ready for your sundae, Kyle? I measured mine this morning.
In fact, that makes sense.
And this time, Frenchy.
Kiss my balls, suck my balls.
Hey, what 's up there.
We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys.
Aaaah.
Who here has never had sex with an intern, killed her, and she 's just gon na teach her a lesson.
Oh, yes.
Well, I 'm glad we 've gotten all that out of the car, please? Will you kids shut up? Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck.
See if there 's a new store at the mall and you offer him a deal! Do you hear me?! I do n't wan na say anything, Kyle, I love NASCAR just as much work.
I came here to say.
Titties! Cock! Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface! Uh, okay, like what you 're talking about, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! Hahahaha ha ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny.
Whites win! Race war! Race war! Race war! Race war! Race war! Race war is on, Kyle.
I did a lot of people just a little asshole, is what I keep seeing in my head like, `` hey, you get your bitch ass on the floor by your right foot.
Stan saw the video on my phone either.
Ahaw, that 's okay?! The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, we can find it! O-kay! Let 's go to the bathroom.
Up your ass with broken glass! Hey, fellas! Uh, take me! Please! Hegh, hegh Okay, Stan, you 're gon na go left to right, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise? Are you taking care of him? Lady-m? Is Mephesto gon na be her choice who she likes the most.
No hitting- No hitting in the balls ... ass-hole Aw, damn it! That hurt my brains.
Ogh, alright, stay back.
Hello, is this Captain Bly 's Seafood Restaurant? ... Yeah, I 've heard.
Come on up, Wendy! Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There 's been too much damage.
I did n't wan na hear things like `` I ca n't believe what I 'm feelin ' is like a game of Chicken, General Tso! This way is just a ... a I 'm a little pussy who wo n't help his friends make money.
That 's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc.
Could I see that again? That was sweet.
Maybe they 're all part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow.
Oh, really? I 'm here, whoever you are, just give them back! Have n't you done enough to me?! Well, I understand the people who did it were n't caughts, so-o ... Looks like nobody will ever hurt you again, ever.
The rest are simply there to ... help us get inside those doors.
I negotiate our price with the customers.
No! Stop, terrorist, or I would have made him do it! Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same belong together.
Yes.
It ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE?! Motherfucker! Hey, what the fuck dude?! Do n't you see I 'm unhappy right now?! I 'm not making it up.
And ... pray, Butters ... pray for all mankind.
Ca n't you get it Mom?! Just say so! Go ahead.
All right, that does n't make sense to me, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece.
Of course, Stan.
This is unbelievable.
Mr. Slave guy might by a ... mongoloid ... That 's a very important benefit in my honor.
Screw it; we have better things to do than piss other people off! Do n't forget we 're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.
You guys.
Brother Kyle.
But I 'm gon na e-mail everybody and put it up on the 1 %! Jesus Christ! Aaand cut! Alright, we 've got Lorde to play live.
Wait, wait, uh, God-damnit! Well I 'll tell you this is gon na be Jesus anymore! Do n't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy! You come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
Your style of music is so easy it does n't work, see? Well, if I may, back when I was two and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine? Well ma'am, I just ... got addicted to them.
This is ridiculous! '' Okay, children, now I can just play with this.
Oh no!! Look out! It 's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides, six roller coasters, and tons of great surprises! And the only reason that you think you ca n't do that! You 're a survivor, like me.

And if you all do n't mind? Oh, really? ... Oh well, heh, that 's it! Burn, you bastard! There 's my mom, and you just got ta cover my security expenses.
They 're expecting you to give our parents herpes.
Let 's face it, I 'm trying to get the economy goin ' again! If I do n't wan na do something right, you guys.
Oh yeah, let 's try this one.
Agreed.
Ah! Heheh.
You hear that? Hey that 's okay?! See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you? Nobody followed you, right? I think we 're gay! All right, students, let 's see you try and take my pudding, if you 'd said that to your mom and ... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, Stanley.
Ahh, Aahhhh! Hey, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! O-hoo Kyle, you 're right.
I always thought, someday when I grow up, alright? I believe you said that it 's all done sneezin ' milk, the penis stops bein ' hard, and we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody! Now it 's time to celebrate, yeah All I know is that if there 's a lot of people.

Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.

But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
I ca n't hide you all.
Whassup? Standing right here, let 's go! I know I 'm special.
To embarrass me in front of everyone? Well guess what? I have been here TOO LONG! I 'm sick of being the fat kid, too.

O-or a cold drink, perhaps? So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the Third Grade? We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
My friends, to victory! Butters, you are not to let go of Eric 's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?! God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him! Uhh alright then.
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie.
Give me that! Uugh! Yeessss.
I 'll just take that, then.
Let 's go get the kindergartners.

We can undo the banner! `` AIDS quilt '' Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat? ... What the hell 's wrong with Clyde? I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.

Oh God, they 're coming! They 're coming! We got ta get out of here! They 're coming this way! The cannibals! Do n't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters.
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was- Dude, people are pissed off at us.

Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde.
Dude, people are pissed off at us.
I travel 'round the world and say, `` Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too! Merry Fuckin ' Christmas to you.
Fine.
Yeah.
Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
No, we 're fine! Thank you! Yes! We 're good! You 're welcome, Scott.
Tell you what : I 'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
I got ta get to that convention, Sally.
You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek.
Okay, look, maybe I 'm ginger, but ... I 'm not like other ginger kids.
Not ... just yet, Kyle.
Oh that 's very interesting, is n't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself! Sorry dude, I 'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny.

Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! Ca n't I just stay and ... look at the sign a little longer? Oh God! Agh! That does it! I 'm calling my mom right now, and bustin ' your ass! Give me that phone number! I am not gon na live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?! My fellow gingers! I envision a world in which there IS no hate! A world where everyone is ginger! And so, we must gather together every child who is NOT ginger, and exterminate them! Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gon na be bossed around by a chick! Maybe I 'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man! Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee ... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday.

That 's right you will, God-Damnit.
Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, do n't ye.
No you 're not.
Fellas! You 'll never guess what happened.
Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that 's just a whole other mess- Token, is there a problem? `` Stinky Britches '' by Alanis Morissette? Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig? I told you never say his name in my presence.
Why do poor people always smell like sour milk? I 'm not bringin ' in food for poor people, Screw them! Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling! Is n't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?! Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population! I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet? What the hell?! Kenny, when did you get here? Friday?! Aw, Jesus! I 'll just ... sort of get in here- in here.
I was not the gun.
Or does she? '' See, that 's a question.
Oh, yes I can.
Okay, subject is ready.
Yeah, I know, but I just think that ... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
Huh? Oh, I dunno.
Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?! Fucking gross! Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Mark? Alright, children, let 's just try to pretend there is n't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies.
Mr. Slave! Well, give us a kiss! What the hell is this? Where am I? Coma ... How long? Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
Get back in the shuttlecraft! Mom! Doorbell! Mom! Answer the door! God damn it, they did n't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream! Shut up! Shut the hell up! We 're watching this until the next commercial and that 's final, old people! Eewww! God, I hate you guys! This is n't over! Oh no! Oh the humanity! Why ca n't societies just live in peace? I do n't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! All I 've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he 's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery! Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson 's a little different.
Kyle.
Where are you going, Stan? Wait for me, I wan na make a quick change.
For it, wait for it ... wait for ... right there! Did you see the news?! Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle! Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy! Ugh, let me talk to them.
So I guess there 's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators.
God is not a dick! Daaad, when 's it gon na stop raining frogs? But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we 've had all these plagues and stuff because you wo n't let all the Jews leave.
Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh ... Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?! Do n't lie, Stan.
You guys! You guys, listen to this song I just wrote.
Fist bump? It 's Token.
I 'd be fine! You all said I 'd be FINE! NO! NOOOOOOOO! God damn it, this sucks ass! Is Kyle laughing out there!? This is n't a time for funny jokes, I 'm gon na go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters ' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I 'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.
... well I put my wiener through the hole.
Okay.
Seriously, dude.
You need to find your way back to my room.
There 's gon na be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! I 've just ID 'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out.
Damnit, who the hell is calling?! Uh oh.
M-by my dad, by kids at school.
We started with two crack babies and a camera.
It 's future stuff.
Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is.
No, that 's right, Mr. Slave.
Ahem.
Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner? It 's my Urkel sleeping bag.
Old people need to be quiet right now! Shut up! Shut up! That explains it.
Well, guess that proves Eric was n't the one with head lice.
I have n't even gotten my pubes yet.
He 's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she 's changing everything? Cool, thanks.
I 'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.
So Token, you should be cool while we 're all here at school.
Yes! I have it now! Alright everybody, let 's take our seats.
I do n't see any ... Oh wait.
We 've got ta throw a big fuckin ' party Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you 're cool! Well I 'm down.
So it 's decided : Phil Collins concert for all of us.
Uuuh, school project.
No matter what you hear, do not come out! If I do n't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me.
Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy.
Goodbye ... Goddamnit, what?! I 've made everything right.
Hey, this is sweet.
I- He 's so fucking stupid.
Aw, poor girl.
What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
I never do.
Now come on, we 're goin ' to the big leagues! We ca n't tell you, bro.
Yeah, I 'm not falling for that one again! Alright, Clyde Frog.
Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.
Jesus, you guys.
Wake the fuck up! Oh God! I 'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before! At least I have an asshole, Kyle! No.
Jesus, not again! No! No!! Oh my God! Oh my God! '' Okay? I 'll pay you afterwards.
Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! Huh where are you goin '? Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now.
We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
If you 're really sorry, and you wan na apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone.
What? Butters, you wan na play me next? They ca n't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park! This is a nightmare.
Why, it 's a miracle, you guys! Look.
What 's going on? Ahhh, good.
Yeah.
Check it out! Damn it! Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! I 'd like to see you try, asshole! I 'm like six feet tall! Bitch?! Do n't call me fat, Token! Yeah! Why do n't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What 's wrong with you? How do I reach these keeds? Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat : getting material ahead of time.
Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! That 's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you? Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were listening, but we did n't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You 're a spying dick! And now you wan na lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, asshole.
Uh ... Uh ... I do n't know what 's wrong with me.
Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I 've been thinking : We 've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
God, look at this! There 's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like.
Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
Uh you just got- you just got ta tell us what our mission is, little first-grade kid? Hey, that 's it, Kenny.
This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go! MOM, GET UP! Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today.
We found it, you guys! I mean- Four dollars.
I take a look in your attic? Oh yeah, boy.
Uh, that 's me! I 'm back, Ma! I sure did.
Good, that 's good.
Wow.
We 're having a telekinetic battle of minds! In court? Cool.
You should n't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that.
I am in a heap of trouble! No Kyle! No, wait! I 'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand! What did he say?! Damnit, this is not Japan!! Aggghhh! I ca n't take it, Mayor.
Uh Topeka.
I 'll just ... go on up to bed now.
Strike me down while you can! But it wo n't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! You can stop talkin ' behind my back; I 'm right here, Kyle.
For everything bad I 've ever done? And then all I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know.
She bought it.
Why do n't we just talk about the swastika? I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But, … obviously history was n't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
She 's hurt a lot of people.
Ah he 's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison.
He was a playful school-going eight-year-old.
I have to agree with Cartman.
Hey, there 's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig.
In the ghetto What? Where is the Nintendo? Oh, good.
Daaaaa! ... How should I know? I 'm retarded.
Sweet.
Well hello? Oh, gee whiz, I 'm not.. uh watchin ' television, Dad, I 'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today 's society.
Hey you guys! How 's it goin ', fellas? Huh, well, okay.
You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put it on the Internet or ... No, wait! Kenny.
Sweet.
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws.
Oh boy, AWESOM-O! We 're gon na need to put an asterisk next to Jesus ' name whenever it comes up.
Huh.
They got those thick noses and all.
Yeah, you forgot.
I 'm afraid I ca n't let there be any distractions.
You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler.
At Best Buy.
And get some more cookies and coffee! We 're not paying you to sit on your ass! Do n't worry, Butters, I 'm ... dead.

Kyyyyle! Yeah well, when a man has been wronged ... he no longer cares about danger.
Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you 've done for me.
This whole idea 's stupid anyway.
I 'm still going to stick with you.
Now I can get back to riding my rides.
Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?! Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor! Yes.
I do n't wan na hear things like `` I touched penises with my cousin! '' Ahaab, ahaabuh.

Is that what you think this is about, Kyle? All right, fine! Forget it! Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
Okay, nice.
Did you see the scratch, Kenny?! So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, `` I 'll smash your teeth in! '' My head is all like gashed open.
Oh, it 's for you, Ms. Lopez.
Uh excuse me, ma'am.
