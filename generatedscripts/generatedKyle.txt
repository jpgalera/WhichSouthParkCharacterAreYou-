What is that? Cartman 's a girl now? What? Hu- How can you feel bad? ... But he 's not gon na do the- I 'm, I 'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
So now, the inevitable question : if terrorists did n't cause 9/11, who did? Remember that there are in fact two towers.
Okay, go ahead.

Calm down, Kenny! Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?! Well, I can! He 's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
You definitely made your point.
He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge! Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not? Where 's that? I 'd love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
But I assure you, I was fast asleep! I do n't wan na spend any money, you guys.

I guess parents do n't give a crap about Smurfs! Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! I really do n't see a problem with it! Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that 's happened to this town in a long time, I just do n't wan na have it in their vaginas?

Trying to find a job will be even harder.
We have to kill Kyle, dude.

Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin ' a little better now.
Here! Now let 's do this! Look! There he is! Yeah, and if you ca n't face that, then you might as well open up! We 're gon na find out who did it.

Dude, just let him come.
Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you.
I 'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I 'm one of them.

Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, I guess I owe it to him to try and change the government 's mind.
Who had the ticket stub? Because our names were called on the commercial last night! We 've got ta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
Not until after Saturday when I go to sleep? Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting.
You 're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We 'll see about that.

How about we do a show where we kill Butters? We have crab people.
It has to be destroyed.
Me?? ) ( This is Eric Cartman.
Excuse me, I need to behave myself.
That 's right! You stay out! ... Alright, fine! You know what Hillary says : `` You can suck my balls! I 've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has to be put away, and he has to be put away now! This is your fault, Cartman! Now they 're just provoking people! It 's like we have the outdoors back again.
Oh, no! ) ( Me too! ) ( Goddamn.

Very nice.
Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they do n't show the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.

Hwat?? Yeah, what if we have n't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
I 'm sorry, but I 'm not finished yet.
These two were in the hallway making out.
You do n't look so good.
I do n't know about this, fellas.
Stop saying `` hella, '' Cartman! How are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay? We do n't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants, and that means they 're dangerous.

The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! We 've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we ca n't go anywhere, fellas.
If you really felt bad, you 'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! Well any God damned second, Kyle! Jesus Christ, what the hell is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?! NO! You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself? Who 's everyone?! Who all is in on this? Kyle! Run! All right, everyone! Forward, march! Es ist Zeit fër Rache! All right, Eric.

And that! And do n't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! Kyle is my friend! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we do n't have any hard feelin 's against you all right? Dude ... Cool.

I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now! We 're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we 're gon na transform into something.
Mom.
So what?! That bitch! I 'm hungry! Ow! You ca n't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it? Hello? Uh, who is this? Uh, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? Ah I 'm really pissed off at your parents.
He does n't look very safe.
Butters, Cartman! I see it! It 's the students ' fault for being so stupid! Oh, well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something.
It was the- Oh, right.
Aaahhh! A note? Okay, Mom.
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
And then Token, and then me.
Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson 's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars.

Really? Do you think he 's a dangerous vigilante? Kenny? And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? Is he a hero or a menace? While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other ... `` Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right? '' What we all need now- Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is only gon na make things worse for me.
