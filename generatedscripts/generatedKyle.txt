What is that? Cartman 's a girl now? What? Hu- How can you feel bad? ... But he 's not gon na do the- I 'm, I 'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
So now, the inevitable question : if terrorists did n't cause 9/11, who did? Remember that there are in fact two towers.
Okay, go ahead.
( What the fuck are you doing?! Oh, you 're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy 's gon na fight you after school.

Calm down, Kenny! Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?! Well, I can! He 's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
You definitely made your point.
He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge! Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not? Where 's that? I 'd love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
But I assure you, I was fast asleep! I do n't wan na spend any money, you guys.

If he were to ever ... switch sides, it could make Stan 's army problematic for us.
Come on, dude! All you 've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he 's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you! Cartman! 'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do! Let 's just get out of here.

Mooom! I ca n't believe I 'm actually going to walk through San Francisco.
He 's like the PewDiePie of music.
You mean like a baker and a cop? Alright, I ca n't tell you.

All the family is scattered, and the living room 's dying.
Ahem ... I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.

And it means a lot that you 're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.
Everyone just shut the fuck up! He 's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I 'm in his garden all the time.
No you ca n't, you ca n't even show his feet.

Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers! Come on! Uuh.
What 's up, bin Laden? Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it 's a ... H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I 'm riding high in Santa 's sleigh.
Wake up, Kenny! You bastard! The Diamond of Pantheos.
You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.

Me too.
Butters so he can lick your balls some more.
Well, I 'm glad people are n't mad at you anymore.

I 've ever done?! ) ( Yeah, it 's um ... it 's uloveboobs.
Yeah.
I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.

If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gon na break loose, but ... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it 's time you showed them who 's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything about it, so, I came as Chewbacca.

No I do n't! I do n't smell anything.
I think so.
You do n't get sucked into it! You do n't think they can get out.
I guess parents do n't give a crap about Smurfs! Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! I really do n't see a problem with it! Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that 's happened to this town in a long time, I just do n't wan na have it in their vaginas? It 's like ... everyone 's turning a blind eye.
Wall Street? So? 'Scuse me.

Okay.
What the? Oh Jesus, I should have known.

Trying to find a job will be even harder.
We have to kill Kyle, dude.

Dude, just let him come.
Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you.
I 'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I 'm one of them.

Excuse me, I need to behave myself.
That 's right! You stay out! ... Alright, fine! You know what Hillary says : `` You can suck my balls! I 've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has to be put away, and he has to be put away now! This is your fault, Cartman! Now they 're just provoking people!

Hwat?? Yeah, what if we have n't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
I 'm sorry, but I 'm not finished yet.
These two were in the hallway making out.
You do n't look so good.
I do n't know about this, fellas.
Stop saying `` hella, '' Cartman! How are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay? We do n't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants, and that means they 're dangerous.

The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! We 've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we ca n't go anywhere, fellas.
If you really felt bad, you 'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! Well any God damned second, Kyle! Jesus Christ, what the hell is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?! NO! You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself? Who 's everyone?! Who all is in on this? Kyle! Run! All right, everyone! Forward, march! Es ist Zeit fÃ«r Rache! All right, Eric.

I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now! We 're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we 're gon na transform into something.
Mom.
So what?! That bitch! I 'm hungry! Ow! You ca n't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it? Hello? Uh, who is this? Uh, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? Ah I 'm really pissed off at your parents.
He does n't look very safe.
Butters, Cartman! I see it! It 's the students ' fault for being so stupid! Oh, well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something.
It was the- Oh, right.
Aaahhh! A note? Okay, Mom.
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
And then Token, and then me.
Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson 's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars.

Really? Do you think he 's a dangerous vigilante? Kenny? And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? Is he a hero or a menace? While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other ... `` Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right? '' What we all need now- Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is only gon na make things worse for me.
