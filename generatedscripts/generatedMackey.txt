Two years ago, and that 's me! That 's not what she said! But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you guys in here wasting your time.
Let 's go take a shower! Let 's do `` Light as a feather, stiff as a board.
I 've done it, General Disarray.
Red Wings? Jesus Christ! We 've tried everywhere! Butters, do you know that without wearing a condom? Do n't you think our name is stupid too? Well then tell him what a bitch she is.

You 're breaking my balls, Kyle.
Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It 's a Jersey thing.

Did you see that first prize for the talent show.
What?! Scuzzlebutt kicks ass! Hey.
Yes! No, they 're gon na understand.
Nobody loves you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my friends commenting on Call of Duty.

We just wan na find some quality friends, you know what I think, that 's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, we 've just been hanging out.
It 's just a stupid list, remember? What is that supposed to mean?! What part of being on an adventure is you go places you 're not.
I remembered that Mr. Hat? Children! Children! A certain student 's mother called me last night.
Being mature is boring! I know you 've had a lot of playing in before you get arrested, all right?! Keep it out of a deal he made! You did n't solve the problem, you just need to ask you a few questions? We ... came to learn the facts about people with red hair and freckles.
Sister Anne? We have crab people.
Oh good.
Is n't that fascism? Do you pee in the community pool.
He forgot about Kenny.
Ugh! We 're going to Butters ' or Cartman 's house.
M'kay kids, let 's get out of my mouth.
I do n't even know who he is! It 's not a demotion, is it?! Come on, people now Hybrids are for people now, hybrid now Hybrid-people-driving people now.
We have to find out why we 're here, and then the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, made him feel there was no way that lady judge is voting for us.

Well, I did.

We have to face the fact that without Cartman we 're gon na fail and Wendy thinks I 'm a total loser.
I do n't know how.
How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Awesome.
Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me my brother and let us get out of here.

I 'll be right back.
Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I 'll ... Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin ' concept? Come on, let 's not fight.
There, you see? We did n't lie, Craig, it was a regular lemonade.
Hey Blanket.
That is my one and only wish.
And so, Kyle, I 've got it.
Do you really think we should talk.
Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal 's office because of your stupid girlfriend! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! ) ( I 'm telling you guys, he 's getting worse.
Aww, suck-up, suck-up! What?! Did you all hear that? Uh I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I ca n't do it ... I ca n't do it! This is totally what 's happening! Thanks, Mr. Garrison.

Stop calling me poor, you fat dick! ... Oh Jesus Christ.
What 's `` saimin ''? Whoa, it 's a long shot! But it 's also the only shot we- got.
Ahem, how 's it going? Why bad? Because they 're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
Yeess! Yeess, Kyle 's money! Mmmm, Kyle 's money! Mmmm, Kyle 's money! Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
You will read it at home, and you will never find it! O-kay! Let 's see you try to open this door now.

Dad, how come you 're not dead yet, Cartman?! Uhhh ... Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ! Give me a Goddamned s-second! Hold it.
Then how does he know our names? Ohhh.
Go ahead.
And then what? Hide it forever from the government? From the ... terrorists who want to use it for evil? Maybe ... maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power.
You just build me up to chop me down, did n't you? Hyeah, that poor, poor thing Well, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right? Maybe? If I had n't called you in the first place.
Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now! Look, however hard you think it for you, it 's a fire.
So? ) ( Our egg is okay.

I knew they would! Now our numbers are truly great.
The Tree of Insight.
Yes they would! What? Dude, that seems kind of ... weird.
Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
That chick Nelly is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! We do n't know.
Eric, for the love of Christ.
I 'm ready.
It 's a chili cook-off with rides.

This is fucking ridiculous.
Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle 's family to get out before the storm hits.
Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.

Well, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton are still trapped in the flood.
Kyle, you wan na do.
O-ho no! We have a sweet name.
Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
Hello? What do you mean `` they 've taken it ''? Oh, this is too much to take.
Please Scott give me my money back.
I endure what I must for the sake of marketing.
You would most likely send your parents.
I 'm still havin ' behavioral problems.
I guess.
M'kay.
Why did n't anyone tell me there was a time phone?! Do n't call me fat, asshole! No! Kenny 's my friend! He 's my son! I adopted him.
I 've got to be kidding me.
( You see? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff.

What 's going on? ... Homeland Security? Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it! Yes.
You know that 's true! Let 's just get out of here.
We have taken Topeka, and now I 'm grounded in real life too! For EVER! It 's okay, it 's okay.
Hey guys, listen! I finally know how you feel.

I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know.
Oh hey dude.
People will just download your songs for free on the Internet! Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! Yeah.
Oh okay, okay.
I ca n't believe Wendy 's gon na go to hell? We will be.
Oh jeez.
Oh, now we 're gon na get Scott Tenorman back! I just finished planning a brilliant li'l scheme that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you break it again, I 'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me? A rapist is here; he 's white! Yes you should contact the fucking police!

And then I say, `` Dare! '' `` Truth? '' But that 's boring! I want to know where I came from.
This is just the beginning.
( Hey, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon? I 'm not fat, Kyle.
We just try ... to live.
But we do n't even have a third act.
You hear that everyone? I 'm gay! All I have to do something to stop this! Come on! Come on, let 's go, bitch.
Um ... Oh waitwait, I know, but there 's going to be o-kay! Thanks, Mrs. Campbell.
So people should not be so upset about killing.
And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, Stan.
Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There 's another army out there who thinks they 're better than me just 'cause they 've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You should n't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that.
Yeah.
Well, that should be fine, just fine.
Uh ... Hooray.
Hey, yeah! Wendy, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do it, we can do it, Kyle! I 'm Raggedy Andy, fatass! I beat you to it, Kyel! That 's kewl! Whatever Kyel!

This is not the school we grew up in, and ... and I do n't want to! I do n't see any ... Oh wait.
Aw, I think he 's right.
I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell.
Stan and Kyle? What? That 's called progress, Kyle.
Oh! This has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal.
Yeah! ) ( Yeah.
Hahaaha! Ha.
Kyle might steal it.
I said `` thank you.
Stupid Bitch '', in D minor.
Seriously guys, you got ta know people.
For what? I think we have to signal them somehow.
Here you get to eat all you want for only $ 6.99.
Kyle, Kenny, and Eric.
Okay children, that 's why he sent me here; 'cause he 's too embarrassed to come himself.
Oh shit! Do n't let that fat turd walk all over you.
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! So? Cartman, there 's something you need to know is I 'm transginger, and you ca n't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude! That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights! Dude! You 're still not staying on long enough! No he did n't kill him, he 's dead! Let 's go! Kyle, it 's hopeless.
Jesus and you are n't.
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with a way -- Oh, stop it! God damn it! Hello? Uh yeah, sorry, I have n't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay? It just so happens that I have your paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gon na do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.. What are we doing? It 's been happening a lot lately.
I thought this was a legitimate business! How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?! Our moms and dads lied to us about the tooth fairy.
People are liking them.

We could never make one that looks real enough.
This guy sucks! Cartman? What the hell is that thing? Children, there 's some crazy stuff going on in this town, is n't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know? I think we should bail.
Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today? Welcome to S-super School News.

Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Red Power! Better red than dead! Better red than dead! Better red than dead! That 's right! Wait a minute.
Grandpa? Oh, is that right?! Do you think I 'm cool no matter what.
Ah, now, where were we? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! You should n't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that.
Ike? Kick the baby! Damn it, Kenny, do n't be gay.
Mr. Hankey song ... Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
( Hey! ) ( Hey, you guys, maybe it 's not all that bad.
You wan na do it in my butt, in my butt? You wan na do it now, not if they already did it on the Simpsons.
They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.
Hey, what the hell are you doing, Cartman? Well, get away from us, bastards! We do n't have any rhythm.
No! You see, Stan?! Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap? We did n't go to your house? Do n't be stupid, Cartman! Hey! Is n't there where Stark 's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish? Why the hell would they want that anyway? Episode I sucked balls.
I 've got one growing inside me.
I 'll expect the same from you.

Run for it! Dude, our parents are gon na blame me.
Lardbut.
What the..? What?? So you blamed the government?! So wait, wait : Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government? So then, you mean ... we do have until 2012.

We 're here to take you back, Mr. Slave! Let 's get out of here? That 's it? Well let 's look in here.
What?! Jesus Eric, he 's gon na die and there 's nothing I can do! They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things are n't real! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Well I saw ... Well he was ... Nothin ' I-I just had a nightmare.
Let 's see : Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection.
That 's their fault! Well they should 've gotten out of there! You got ta come to his house right away.
Tell me again why it ca n't be.
No.

Hey guys.
Again! Now you sound like white people! The answer to # 27 is 5.

No? What does that have to do with me? I 'm sure two boys can handle an egg just fine ... And if not, we 'll certainly prove a point to that goddamned Governor, wo n't we? Oh yes, we 'll find out today at recess, wo n't we? Never mind, just carry on, children.
Magic : The Gathering ''? Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns.
Kyle! Because they do n't fucking care! I 've told you this! They do n't just allow them, they have them available at the front.
That should just about do it.
Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you do n't.
Right on! Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I 'm like, you know, I learned something today.
Excuse me, sir? I think I 'm gon na win the contest with a squash? Whoa, Stan.
Butters.
It means, like, you know, you 'll just have to find my dog.
N-n-no, you retards! The video s ... tore! Well, I guess I 'd better be careful how I look.
If they ca n't raise or lower, there 's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Wow! Ah ... a a a meth lab? What is a meth lab, anyway? Nah.
Well, I know lying 's bad, Dad.
Ugh.
Okay, I 'm gon na become a NASCAR driver, Butters.
Now they thnk they can walk all over you.
Tomorrow? Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30.

That 's not funny! Right now? Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa! We 've been waiting forever! H-hang on, guys, my dad said he 's too busy with the Broncos.
Phew.
... Alright, just what the hell do you have more friends than me? How many friends do you have, Kenny? What?! Wait, we 're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure? So what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with what I was seeing.
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
Dude, you did n't.
Hey, Cartman? How much do you pay for this stuff? Okay, quit the act! I 'm not that stupid! Just for that, I 'm peeing sittin ' down like a dainty dignified little woman! Sany, any of you ladies wan na go see High School Musical 3? Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn! ... What? And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like- Oh hello, Mr. Mackey.
Giant Douche still wins! What the? Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, Kyle.
I might have been still-born, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000! I do! I just- Ike no! Stop! We 're so sorry.
This is ridiculous! Lunchtime! I 'm starved! That 's me! They do n't even have enough weight to move.
Uh.
It 's a deal! All right, Eric, you 've got to believe me! '' `` You 've been most uncooperative, Ms.
You 'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I 'll kick you in the nuts! Ey! Do n't call me bitch! I 'll kick your ass and rape your lass.
I thought `` I can find us a way out! '' I ran off and went searching for, I do n't know.
That 's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
They 're coming! They 're not gon na win the contest with a squash? Whoa, Stan.
Oh, dude, I 'm Jewish, a-and you know ... Jews ca n't be pirates because they do n't have us do 'em anymore.
You 'll never take us alive! We 're going tomorrow night! Cartman 's got the bus schedule all figured out! Well, of course your parents said you ca n't go! Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude.
This is fucking ridiculous.
What? What?? Hey, hey Kenny! You love NASCAR huh? You see I told you guys! Here it is, right here.
W-what are you doing?! Kyle, what the fuck?! They ca n't do that! I wo n't say a word.
If you do n't, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween! I do n't wan na look like a total dork in front of her and spit on the ground.
You ca n't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle.
Goood boy.
Yeah, so what? So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
Can I please be excused from class? I do n't get it.
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! What? You mean, we make something that looks like boobs to take a picture of him for his mom to have.
No it 's not cool! Ike is n't old enough to understand.
Ms. Secretary, that will be all.
We 'll just see about that.
Dude, we 've created a monster.
No.
I know a girl that 'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars! Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes! Boy oh boy.
... kind of into me lately.
Now ... we have an army of our own! I ca n't! God damn it! What the hell? Hey, what are you doing? Detective Marsh.
I 'm every bit as good as Kyle is.
Nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications! Then we 'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now! Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it is n't so funny now, is it? Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures.
It 'll be so much easier havin ' you do it from now on.
That ... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology? Stuffing was n't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been ... alien technology? Wow, check it out, guys; you do n't even have cable! Kenny 's not afraid of you! Six hundred dollars, you guys! So what are you gon na take us somewhere or not?! Alright, we 'll try this again.
They 've never been allowed to walk before.
Eric Cartman, it 's Eric Running Water.
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean! Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton.
I did n't wan na have to buy a Batman costume.
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric.
We sure had a ... terrific time.
Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah! But, but he 's a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.
Dude, what does the note say? Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
Jesus! Look at me, I 'm riding high in Santa 's sleigh! Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll! Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her? Platform 4F.
Really? What am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin ' on? Everyone is startin ' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of a deal he made! You did n't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing! What should we do with him? Oh my God! '' Okay? I 'll pay you afterwards.
A mom should n't be able to stop them from watching what they wan na watch.
Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, this is gon na make us all listen to it again 'cause you could n't understand? Really? '' ... Shuttle? Uh that 's probably bad.
He wo n't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
They 'll think you wrote it all.
`` Curse words '' They 're called that because they are a curse.
( He 's not gon na do it, dude.
The government is gon na nuke Imaginationland.
A Thurilian miner?! Look, you 've got it, no problem- OP.
Well, sorry, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we 'll all engage them in simple conversation.
This ... is Butters.
Cool! Thanks, Chef! Are you old Frida? Someone who wants a favor.
Oh.
Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that- I 'm tired of it.

The fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.

I have to die, but if I die, everyone 's sins will be forgiven.
We can undo the banner! `` AIDS quilt '' Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat? ... What the hell 's wrong with Clyde? I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
I believe you will go to hell.
Balls so dry they explode like dust.

Rraahhhh! Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All! Surrender?! No, the heck with that! Well I wo n't do it.
Eh fah, fag drag? Governor, we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill! Because you 're the governor? Well, think of the children! If you allow gays to get married, then you 're also givin ' them full rights as parents to adopt.

And that 's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
Say guys, 1776 was so long ago.

Tell him, Kyle! Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy! Ugh, let me talk to them.
I 'm finally gon na have mature friends who I can relate to.

But you 're gon na miss it! They 're gon na do it! Wow wee, look at him go! Uh ohhh.
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus? But we actually are busy.
Well, be careful, ghost pal.
To honor this special time of year we 'll be doing a canned food drive.
For what?! This is exactly what I 'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools.
Well it 's just that ... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a ... well, like a dick.
Go on then! Say your last words! Okay fine, let him speak! Then we kill every non-ginger here! You ... you what? Right, the plan.
( You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that! ) ( Heheheh.

Yeah, something feels ... unfinished Here you go, Kyle ... And here 's yours, Stan ... They 're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
You got served! That 's right! As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! I 'm not going to! Uch, I did n't think so-You know, I 'm just bein ' paid to hand out flyers.
You see Mr. Hat, we do n't have much time! Damnit, Kenny! Ca n't this thing go any faster? Craig, are we still clear? Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it! Stop right there, Ike! Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex! Ex, excuse me? My name is ... Brad.
A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he 's here now! Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way! Are you sure? He 's closer to a panther than you 'll ever be! Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin ' whales.
No, no, he said not cool.
Where are we? I do n't think the writers even knew what that was about.
Oh crap.
The old gray goose is ... Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday to ... Actually, this is High School Musical 2.
Do you think he can ride the bull? Cool.
Wait a minute.
What?? Cartman, we ca n't do a presentation on underpants gnomes.
You what?! But I never practiced quarterback.
Did you get to any dirty parts yet? I do n't get it! All right, can you explain to me what 's going on?! What do you mean `` That 's all right ''! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?! That 's nice.
Was it that I was ugly?! Oh, my God! What the hell are you talking about? They did? Why? Of course! Cartman, our parents sent us over there to get us sick! They knew that staying at Kenny 's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
Kenny! My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, are n't there, Chef? Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure! Robert Smith, hit her nose.
But ... but why do they hate each other? Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve? Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth.
No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny.
Oh you think that 's funny, huh?! Yeah, that 's basically it.
Dude, I 'm sorry.
No, that was just a dream.
Why the hell do n't people tell me these things?! What 's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party 's gon na suck.
Nnoo.
... deh..OOOWW!!! Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole! But he 's just using his time on television to rant about- Oh my God! Dude, you 've been in here crying all morning.

What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go! Well, screw it! We 'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated! Me neither.
I 've started : the American Liberation Front.
Dude, I 'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me! Oh really? Oh okay.
Get me down from here! I 'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family 's Christian! No! I 'm not doing you anymore favors and I 'm not letting you guys screw me over again.
Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals! They 're coming this way! I can hear them coming.
Ohh, rainbows.
You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek.
Cartman! Looks like you did n't get much sleep last night.
Yeah.
Anyway, Stan, you 've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?! Impress Wendy?? What the hell? What have you done? When we said `` documentary, '' I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo! Oh yeah, that one 's cool.
Mom! Seriously! Let 's go to the, uh, media.
And they 're all shot.
Do n't call me fat, Token! Yeah! Why do n't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What 's wrong with him? That is very impressive, Eric.
At this school, it does n't matter who it is.
I actually hugged you.
Nuh uh! ) ( FIVE BUCKS??? ) ( I think so too.
The, there was a techno dance club.
Let him out, Cartman! Is he in there? I knew Kenny could n't fit in that tea pot! Why would they play such a cruel joke on us? Goddamnit! There has to be a rational explanation.
Token.
Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! You will read it at home, and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language! Herbert Garrison likes Butters ' comment.
You wan na kill me?! Fine! I ca n't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! They did? Who confessed? That does n't make any sense.
Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.

Wow! You know, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
Uh, that 's a good Precious.
Butters, get your coat.
Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys ' looks? I know, but then ... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.
No, I ca n't say that I have.
Excuse me.
That 's the chemical equation for gold? ... Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up? Yeah! What does that mean? How about geebo, or, or mung? Hey, that 's not very nice, Mayor.
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe.
Ech.
What would a priest want to stick up my butt? What? Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he 's tryin ' to crap out his mouth.
I I 'm sorry, I just ... I think bullying has gotten out of hand.
Ah, I need to go.
Did you hear that? He 's shuffling his deck already.

Daaance! Dance, damn you!! Shut up, Cartman! Whoa! You can say that again.
I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they 're all getting really annoyed.
And I 'm Rick Cartman.
I mean, he could die, Kenny.
There 's got to be a way out of this.
All right! Did you get to any dirty parts yet? I do n't get it.
Who should we help? Cartman : I say we help Santa Claus! Cartman : ' Ey! I do n't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! How did you guys know? Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella! Every time I go to my Grandma 's house, she gives me a present.

Oh jeez n-no, I I do n't know what 's gotten into you, but ... I I think it 's pretty amazing.
Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison, I 'm spending it.
Ddue, we have to try! Mighty powerful network executives, Please do n't cancel us.
They 're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me! Everyone get up and go over to that wall! I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them.
Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig? I told you never say his name in my presence.
Uh here we go.
Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? Kenny! Kenny, wake up! Wake up, Kenny! You 're not gon na win the costume contest! A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can explain this whole thing.
It 's okay.

I have no idea what you 're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I 'm gon na go upstairs and make my bed now.
Yeah, of course.
Dude, my mom 's having her monthly visitor.

Sirs, uh, if you 'll just let- Dude, I have no idea what- I believe there is a ... few things wrong with the school, but- Look, Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! We can? Whoa.
Huh, invasion pran.

This is how this first shot is gon na work : The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool.
So, I 'm sorry.

Go enjoy the rest of your recess.
Stop it! Ow.
Ca n't you get him to talk? I have to know why! Right here and now—we 're gon na talk about this! What the hell are you talkin ' about? Oh, I 'm sorry, but you 're a little flat.

That ' all it is, sliding down a cable.
In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I 'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I 'm gon na get those killer sai.
Butter-butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly.
Heelp! OH GOD, IT 'S GON NA KILL ME! What the-? This is n't safe or fun! NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this is n't right! Kyle! Hey, Kyle! I know what you mean, Kyle.
Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves.

What is that? Oh no, he did n't.
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.
I I love life.
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they 're gon na be so angry! Maybe they did n't see me.

Hey.

We ca n't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we 're responsible for Ms. Claridge 's accident! Look, that was a long time ago.
Come on, come on.
And in America, if something sucks, you 're supposed to tell Cartman he 's being racist or something? Kyle.
I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- Gorak 's a gay name.
Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because ... Yes Kenny, what is it? I thought you just came from the bathroom.
Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Oh, thanks.
You dirty motherfucker! Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, have n't we, class? If you do n't make the right choices in life, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
But he ca n't live with the guilt anymore.

Jesus Christ! Oh no ... Help.
All we do is rent out the rec center overnight.
According to that scale, I still have a small wiener! I 'm still fucking angry! Oh.
All right, I guess it 's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave 's ass.
We ca n't let them do that! Dude you have to stall them! Uh- ... uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone! No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
You 're the spokesman, Cartman! But you 'd better not screw it up! We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they 're insane.

So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well let me help you.
Why aliens? Aliens do n't belong in an Indiana Jones movie? Come on dude! There 's nothing we can do.
So what can your company give me for 'em? ... Oh Randy, you 're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson.
Kick ass.
You know, I think the car might be movin ', Mom.
The bread 's all flat! No! I 'm not willing to give up! Chef would n't give up on us.
He 's South Park 's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.

But I thought about you all day long.
I told you guys.
Yeh-yeah.
Something that should have been done a long time ago! Watching what Photoshop is doing to society ... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they ca n't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
Okay, let 's try it again.
Dude, please wake up! You 're a grown man in a psychiatrist 's office! Is that why we 're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip? Ohhhhhhh.

Piece of crap.
Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny.
You do n't need David Blaine to tell you how to live.
Hands?! Let me see those hands! Where 's your pass?! Show me your hall pass! You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass! All right, cool, brah.
Tih- Tooth? What the hell?! This game 's all boring now! Dude, screw this! Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?! Aww, books? God, I hate those! Oh really? Sweet.

Jesus ... we 're not talking about an object here, we 're, we 're trapped in Beaverton, We 're, we were trying to save everyone! No, Dad, listen : I need to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.

So then, who was responsible for 9/11? Huh? What 's he doing at his teacher 's house? Hello? Excuse me, I need to get laid.

Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future?? Where is he now? Liver medicine? Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch 's wallet?! Butters, do you really wan na just go back to school, where people just make fun of you? Yes! Do you really wan na go back to being a man, '' and he says `` There 's been too much damage.
