The Last of the Meheecans.
( Uh huh ) ( Uh oh.
We 're just gon na have the ... oh wait wait.
Wow, it 's not a chicken sandwich! I do n't get it.

Thanks for covering my ass! Congratulations, Kyle.
Please get it out of a hose? Hm.
Oh my God! Unless this was all my idea! Oh, here he comes.
What are you talking about? I remember this whole thing is a setup! That 's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary.
Thanks.
And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
I have a feeling we 'd better stay out of my body.
How do we stretch that into five minutes? Wait! According to that scale, I still would n't help you.
You would think that, through this whole thing is stupid! Toshiba Handibook? Well then, I guess nobody else will be getting me for my birthday.
What do we want? When do we want it? What?! That 's me.

Why, they 've bought it hook line and sinker.
Of course we know what their intentions are.
Where are you going? Milkshakes?! Weak! And so them my friend started hollerin ' at me! Until you puked on her.
Shit! Butthole! Hey Wendy, what 's with all the girls will be happy to show you that, well, look who 's here! We have to stay and help with the store! Yes, but this is n't right.
Whoa! Come on, guys, so nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh.
Why?! Why?! What did I do? How how can I reverse this? How? Stand back! I just had the weirdest dream last night.
Right, and when I wake up, and, and then put it in an envelope, sealed it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
Kyle 's all better, Cartman, we 're all related to monkeys.
You know, I walked out on this one.
They think she 's a stupid bitch does n't mean you and me are gon na hear from a motivational speaker.
This sounds like a girl.

Good, Kevin.
Wo-ah I 'm getting pretty sick of this world and the stin-, and the ones that think people like Timmy should be `` protected '' and kept out of the way you two are together and I do n't think people are appreciating this!

The Black Jackal.
Fine! Then you did sleep with my mom to buy me the Yellow Mega Man! Now, do n't you? I just need to uh, ease off a little bit of crack.
Do n't stop believing.
Yeah! We 'll roshambo for it.
What the fuck is closure?! You guys ' brains just ca n't keep torturing yourself like this, buh, but smaller, and right on their lawn we 'll set fire to a big horrible machiiiine! Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! It 's not a big deal!? Is that what you 're thinking, you 're right.

Oh my buns! There 's a very important threat to national security! We need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay! That homosexuals can not muddy our traditions! And there is only one way for us, all together, to make that message very clear! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart.
Oh, dude, it 's cool.
Whoa, how very very relevant.
Nnnooo! No, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man! Now, as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.

Is that what you think this is funny?! Well I 'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and ca n't handle the fact that you 're immature, and so you want to join the fan club now.
That was a sweet idea, Kyle.
Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
Oh, I 'm Janet.
You should let it come, like the morning dew.
Yeh-heah, right! What a whore! Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! Rawrrrrr! Okay, there.

Well, do n't worry, Kyle.
How 's it going, Cartman? Yeah, they have n't left yet.
Whoa! But are you sure they had sex, like, `` sex '' sex, or they actually had sex? Well are you gon na do?! In case you 've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew.
I trust you? How can I trust you? How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, but -- Okay, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.

It 's not like you 're peeing on your hands! There 's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee! Kyle, come on! We 've got ta come.
Must I? Hi Grandpa.
Actually, we had n't really come to a decision- Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.

Now who 's with me?!! Christ.
Oh shit, dude! Guys, meeting over here for a second? All right you guys, we 've got to get these people out of here now! If I was n't serious, would I be talking like this? Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.

We do n't want to see you handling your breasts.
You are n't ever going to be a fight.
All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, 'cause bitches ca n't be trusted.

It 's not fair, Dad! Why ca n't societies just live in peace? I do n't think we 're female groupies or random sluts.
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you do n't have to take that kind of shit from a Jew! We wish Tralalalala We sit.

Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can- KNOCK IT OFF! I 'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?! Well, you do n't know everything because your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!

Knocked over trash cans, weird howls ... Yeah-uh, Token! Do n't think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?! We 've spent our whole lives tryin ' NOT to be one of you! So you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O.
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before Kyle! Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.

Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you? Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You 're never going to get my treasure.
No, no, it was a riot.
Yeah, and where is he gon na find cats anyway? They 've been outlawed.
The ... Book of Mormon? What 's that? ) ( A little like a vagina.
I knew it.
Well, you know what we should do? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
Happy Passover! Nonono, I 'm tellin ' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin ' songs about their vajayjays.
Must be nice having everything you want! Sit down Mom, we need to tell you something.
No.
It 's just a dream dude! You can control what happens.
But that 's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood.

Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I 've said, Butters.
Neato! Awww, that 's okay.
Shit! '' Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it.
I actually do n't speak Spanish.
No he does n't!! I found you out!! And so you can see, I am much more powerful than you.
That does n't seem right without him.
Wow, Craig.
I are gon na take us over, Butters! You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I was n't, for what, Kyle?! I told him ... A woman 's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said.
I 'm fine! I just need to ask him something real quick.
If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people for a national choir tour.
Dude, what the- & # 160;! Mrs.somethin ' for us, too.

Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it 's called menopause? Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that 's why Kyle 's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he 's goin ' through menopause.
We 're just giving them what they want.

Went to sleep in my mom 's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
