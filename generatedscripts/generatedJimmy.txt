Ey, sweet! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! But you see what I can and ca n't do this! This is for your own good, Brother Kyle, we 'd like to return this Margaritaville.
Mmm, one more time, I 'm telling you that I have sex, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it? Well, very impressive, Mark.
What the hell are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted you to be near the pony when they arrive.
So does that mean? Right.
Dude, that sucks! I 'm pumped I 'm psyched.
Four days ago, he 's dead! Let 's go! If we 're gon na be HELL to pay! All I did was pick a random name and wait for the parents to see it.

Damnit, we have to do? What does it mean? Why would I invite Kyle? You chicken? Ugh! Yeah.
Whoa! Heh, heheh.
More people need to be up! We 're pretending like nothing happened.
{ Maybe he took a dump and got sick.
Just say, `` It puts the lotion on its skin or else it dies, and it goes something like this happen? But, you can not put Corey Duran 's death on me! Ngh, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
Well, I 'm just bein ' the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is that? Oh, good, ya.

Gaaah! Heeee! Hey, you guys.
Well, I understand what you 're thinking, Stan.
Uh ... no, that 's fine.
Come on! Everyone 's gon na go get the goods on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the mall.

What is her agenda? She 's what?? Okay okay okay.
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend 's face.

Kind of nice out tonight, huh? You guys are my best friend.
Hey-heh, that thing has really got sand in it 's vagina! What a stupid voice.
Heheh, you suck it.
Tweek, we 're sorry dude, but guys just do that.

But it 's not.
At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to live in a rotten part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow.
I 'll do what I waunt! What-evah.
You dumb bitch! Butters, can you tell me what year the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
Turns out he was a fag.
So you are n't.
It 's like my brain just keeps ... jacking off.
Heheyehah.
I say tomato! Tomato! Tomato! Tomato! Tomato! What? I just ca n't sit on your ass! I 'm pumped I 'm psyched! Alright.
Fantastic, then.
( It 's the girls that give us diseases! Yeah, like assisted suicide.
Why would we look at a newspaper, retard? Really? How big is my file? Uhh, excuse me, Doctor, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
Our planet is just a stupid fad, right? Where to now, Chef? Dude! Dude, check it out.
I do n't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they 're going to watch episode # 203, Barnaby Under Siege.
Happy Deadline Day! Oh boy, this is hella weird.
Yehes! ) ( Sure you can.
I put on exactly the same album that I really hate this kid named Blanket and he has thus refused.
Look, Kenny, can I have your attention please? Yes, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
Eh.
( Yeah.
Noooo!! You sent me back too far! It 's not hard, it 's clear.
2217.
You do n't get it.
Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? Oh, Jesus, for being so special.

He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while? But, … obviously history was n't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, and, give me that! Uugh! Yeessss.
Let 's see you try and stop me?! Well, this should be good.
I have no idea what you 're fixin '.
I 've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls.
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we- we 've got to focus, and remember.
And then this other time, I again get six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.
You know what I'mm gon na miss him.
That means crap your pants.
Oh my God, they 've killed Kenny! It was n't? So then, so then we put my mom 's boobs.

Let it make a happy glow- Fever ... Light ... lightheadedness ... I do n't wan na get the numbers right! We did it, Butters.
Kyle, I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been one big screw-up, you know? Why? There 's these two people ... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be.
This is my friend! I 'll run home and get in shape.
Well okay, but Dad, the movie trailers! That looks AWEsome! Oh, he 's not fat at all.
His body? Well, if Cartman is the only memeing I 'll ever do.

Alright, it 's November.
You heard the priest : the first thing to do.

This is n't about you, okay Bebe?! HA! I beat you to it, kids.
Hi guys, what 's there to hate about rainbows? Cartman, tell us.

I could pretend I 'm talking to you Kenny, achtung! Poor piece of crap, but we 're gon na kick you both right in the place where kids are being transformed into vampires.
And I will work hard, for you.

Hup hup.
But thanks to you! Hey, wait! Uh I can explain.
Oh boy! Y-yeah! Oh, yay! ) ( Woohoo! ) ( Here.
What 's the fun in that? Ike? How about this : right now, I 'm sure she 's already trying to figure a way to get attention for yourself because you 're too grumpy and negative to believe it.
Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ! Give me that back! We 're only $ 167 away from gettin ' a Sega! Tell us about it! It was ridiculous.
You 're free.
Get near the puck! Tie? Well, all alright, Goddamnit! Now, come on, Kyle! ) ( Uh huh.

Hey, fellas! It 'll be so much fun! You mean I have the guts to do what we please! We get all that we want for free! We have n't gotten my period yet.
I 'll blow your friggin ' head off.
I thought I could just spend one day in their shoes ... if I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what you 're thinking, Stan.
On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers : Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
Would you guys like to see if they build a dam! Barely! `` Rise above it! '' YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh?

I knew how to spell.
Alright, next? Whip it out, Butters.
Kyle.
Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
Jesus Christ monkeyballs.
Not.
Ugh! You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet! Look at, look at the description.
I think I 've just made this a whole lot worse.
He 's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
Oh, hello, son.
Let me see! Jeeeeezz! What do I do? What do I say?? Cartman, no! O-ogh ... It ... did? Pick me up.
I will! Yeah I 'm good.
She 's just stuck, Stan.
Sure, if they did n't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they 'd be bummed out, but it 's not my fault! Dude, I did n't know it was you guys.
... pissed off! Goddammit! No, nothing No, nothing here! Nothing this way! Tr ... treasure.
I ca n't watch! Let 's get out of here.
Huh? ) ( Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay! ) ( Hey, you guys.
Something he said.
But I won the environmental essay contest.
He does n't even know what he wrote about! My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.
What are you up to? I just think it 's a fabulous app, that 's all.
Heh, heh.
Where could he be? Sparky! Sparky! Fine, how are you? My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Yeah, but, mom! Dad, Death is coming! Dammit! You know, I, I feel like I 've run a marathon.
Kyle.
Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, mother.
I 'm like, you know, the usual stuff.
Every idea 's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
You 're a fuckin ' asshole! ) ( Fuck yeah! ) ( Me too.
Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
I just have to accept that.
I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Well dude, what are we supposed to do with it? It might hold the key to a curse.
Not guilty! ) Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop! Dudes! ( What the hell are we gon na do that? Does it hurt? I do n't wan na have to buy a Batman costume.
You gon na be a fuckin ' narc and show that b-bottle to the ... coaches?! Do n't think you 're any better than me, Timmy! I 'm just living in the real world! Fuck! Y-yeess! Grrrr! Yeah, I 've been working this beat for about three days now.
The moment of truth is here.
We ca n't do this without you now! Come on! You ca n't go to the bathroom, you 're stacking sunder armor! Dude, I 'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore? Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! Kevin, Goddammit! We be headin ' to Somaaliaa.
That 'll just be four dollars.
Do n't you think I 'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! Dowww! Eh! I 'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Now look : I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one.
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television! You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium! Planetariums suck ass! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls! I 've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused.
God, this is sooo cute.
You ca n't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me! I 'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ.
Dude, look at the walls.
They ca n't do that.
Ehyes, Mark? Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark? Well, very impressive, Mark.
There 's more of them! Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now.
... I 'll split the money with you.
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that 's stupid, Dad.
Dude, that 's not a digital sports watch.
Alright, you ready? Now say `` I 'm a dork, and I deserve what 's coming to me.
Because, by the time you see this commercial, I 'll be ... dead.
It's- Ohmygod! You 're not gon na believe this! Oh my God, they 've killed Kenny! Agggghhh! Then we have to stop it before it gets there! Cartman, you have to stop! No?? So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows? My God! Over here, over here! Less than 20 minutes?! Well, who did n't see that coming? ... nine, eight ... Dude! You got ta build us another time machine! W-what did you get in a fight about? Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me! That 's weird, because I really did n't cut off my hand.
Podcast? Sure dude.
Ugh! God, you guys are so cisginger.
They 're gon na hurt our chances.
I know, it sucks.
You 're the only person I can trust.
Chef 's money! It 's illeg --! No more Chef.
You 're a fuckin ' asshole! ) ( Fuck yeah! ) ( Me too.
My penis looks great! How long before it 's ready? Let me see if it feels right in my hand.
You just could n't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
Uhhh, hmmm.
Ugh.
Me.
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! Lorde is my dad.
I think there 's somethin ' supernatural goin ' on.
Dad.
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait ... Butters ' chin? Uh, but that 's me.
I guess I did n't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?! HA! Alright, give it to me.
Wow, what a terrific audience.
It does n't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick! ... It 's not okay! Defeating the Chinese wo n't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick! God damn it! No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I What happened?! Good! Did you kill him? Dude ... Dude! You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it.
Christ! Who did this to you, Mr.
Jesus! This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals! I have to agree with Cartman.
Is there a problem Kenny? Let 's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay? Okay children, let 's take our seats.
Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time! Professor Chaos! Let 's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! Yeah Mom, I 'm just goin ' outside for a little while.
I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing.
Dad! Give up on your dream! Hey no, no.
Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys! What kind of video did you guys make? Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants.
I open it on Christmas, I 'll act all, like, surprised, like `` Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise! '' U-huh, nice costume, Kenny.
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants.
Me neither.
Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world! Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie! And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say `` Es ist Zeit für Säuberung, '' you all chant back `` Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! Es ist Zeit fër Rache! All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians ... No, those are fine.
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms ' breasts for anatomy class.
What the hell was that? ... Dude, you 're not gon na believe this! Okay.
Yeah, but seriously, it 's like there 's no real thing to hang on to, you know? I admit it, I was I was sexually lost.
We just have to face it.
Butters, my soul is finally at peace.
Oh do n't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys did n't buy into the bracelets does n't mean you 're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you 're gon na shoot him.
What is that? I think so.
Yeah.
Where 'd you get those? Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
... Oh that makes sense.
And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say `` Es ist Zeit für Säuberung, '' you all chant back `` Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Then let 's move out! Everyone hold! Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And ... Right-click! What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow! Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, you asshole! '' And Clyde is all like `` Mom, leave me alone! What? Well, that does sound pretty good.
... but I 've learned that we ca n't judge people based on what they look like.
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
It 's a Jewish tradition! It 's called a circumstision! Dude, I asked five different people.
Stan, huh? Uh how come they 're laughin ' and fallin ' down and such? Uh let me handle this, Stan.
Uh let me on! Let me on! Haaah! Aaah! Nooo! Haaa! Cartman? Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha! They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub.
Dude, it was complete brutality! At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card.
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys ' brains just ca n't compute complex plans like mine can! It 'll work, you 'll see.
Oh okay, okay, I just wan na stay in my room- Tru ... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa! Dad! Mom! I 'm don- I 'm done playin ' now! Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad! Mom, will you get Dad out of here? That 's it? That 's all the commercials? Shh.
Huh? Hello? Who is that? Get out of here! Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they 're gon na attract something much worse! The college know-it-all hippies.
You guys said you were badasses! What you assholes acted like you were doing? Wait for it ... wait for ... right there! Did you see the news?! Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle! Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy! Ugh, let me talk to them.

I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box! There we go.
Whooaa! You wan na take it out for a spin? Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone! Butters, that 's all drones are for.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wan na be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Stay away from Butters! He 's humanity 's last hope! Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!! Aw man, he 's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! That 's how you want it, bitch?! Fine! I hate you! Hey dudes.
You alright dude? What?! I 'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
Hey Jimmy, what are you doin ' with him?! That 's my robot! AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend? We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles The world seemed to all make sense but that sense seems to slowly fade After Third Grade In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue We had warm cookies and hearts full of love And there was n't a care in the world! Yeah.
Ah, Mr. Garrison, I 'm fine.
You may suck our collective balls, sir! I told you guys, it 's wrong! It 's WRONG!! It 's wrong! Yeah, Kyle.

You see, I was Kenny 's ... BFF.
Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay! Kyle! Kyle!! Well, looks like at least you 've got some sense left in you, Kyle.
And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I 'll do what I want! No, wait! Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gon na throw down! Well it 's on, it 's on, itsonitsonitson! They, uh they are n't gon na show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
Joyful all ye nations rise Join the triumph of the skies `` Hark, '' the herald angels sing Yeah, that 's fine.
Boy I 've, I 've really been having a tough time.
Did she get a haircut or something? Yeah.
You 're awesome.
We 're not quadruplets, Terrance.
Wo n't you, girls? Okay, children, I 'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers.
Come on, AWESOM-O! We 're gon na have pizza and cake and a sweet band! Oh my God, you guys are sooo stupid! Yes! I want to get `` Dare '' to kiss her.
Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
Try their lunch specials.
Bathroom! Bathroom! Bathroom! All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose.
Melita, hold on.
Eric, you 've never been anything but a problem for me! You 're taking that egg! And if you break it again, I 'll break both your legs, and burn down your house! Do you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away! That 's right, and I ... Fake treasure? Noo ... NOOO!! NOO! OW! Do n't you think I 'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! Dowww! Eh! I 'm sorry I caused so much trouble.

A noble trait that seems lost on you 99 % ers.
We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! I ca n't lose this extracurricular credit.
Damnit, you do n't raise your hand if you do n't know! It sure is, Mr. Hat.
Not working out? Well, but ah I can get better.
Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
Dad could get Mom for their anniversary.
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle.
But now you need to teach a new message.
Oh man, you 've got to see the pony! Well, e-yeah, but, there 's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
It 's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh ... Jesus! This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole! I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
It 's okay.
We do n't get to go to Scotland? Oh well.
I 'm glad we 're best friends now.

You ca n't do this! God damn it, this sucks ass! Is Kyle laughing out there!? This is n't a time for funny jokes, I 'm gon na have your and your boyfriend 's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you 'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
The setup could be ... `` Do you like fishsticks? He 's right.
Two thousand dollars.
Hah! Oh my God! ) ( Woohoo! ) ( Hmmm.
I finally felt at home.
How many of our species survived? It was n't? So then, you mean ... we do have until 2012.
I do n't know.
Yeah, that 's fine.
Heh, we apparently do n't say 'side dishes ' at the table, either.
Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
Wait a minute! You guys ca n't scare me! Was that how it happened? God-dammit, how long is this commercial break gon na be?? Wait a minute! You 're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out? But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.

I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one.
God! You guys are such pussies! Hemmm ... No, just a bunch of goo.
They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
Pay attention children! I 'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you! After school! We fight after school! You got that?! That 's emotional character development based on what 's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy.
Cartman still is n't around.
Where 's the Wii? Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe! I do n't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii! No ... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! This is terrible.
Okay, okay I 'm freaked out.

With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Bye.
You 're not listening to me, Kyle.
Dude, we need your turkey for our play! I know, I know, but listen : the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
Why oh oh? Yahtzee? Ca n't we play on speeder bikes or something? Yahtzee.

I ... I d-did n't think a knife could really hurt me.
Any word on who shot up me and Timmy 's houses, officer? The ... B-Bloods? The-they do?? But ... but why do they hate each other? Oh, so you 're really famous and important but you do n't know that.
No! COME BACK! Come back please, this is n't right! Kyle! Hey, Kyle! I know what you 're saying to yourself : You 're saying, `` Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent? '' Right? Token, the truth is that without representation, you 're in danger of being taken advantage of.
Will you please just cooperate and not -- You ca n't be the dwarf character, Butters, I 'm totally poor and stupid.
Just for that, I 'm gon na use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
Dude, can I go before you? So ... you do n't like Family Guy either, huh? So what 's your plan? You 're gon na ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?

Kill ... you ... guys! Kill you guys!! What?! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We ca n't trust anybody here, Butters! Do n't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States! No! God damn it we 're serious! We 'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! Dude!
