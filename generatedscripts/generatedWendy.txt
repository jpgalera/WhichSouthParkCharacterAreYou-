Do you think I 'm talkin ' about, Butters? It 's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there 's too many of them now! Do n't think that you can buy and raise in your room! Look! Sea people.
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one.
If they ca n't raise or lower, there 's zero chance of anyone falling in.

Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think he 's a dangerous vigilante? Kenny? And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? Is he a hero or a menace? While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other ... `` Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right? '' What we all need now is PROOF ... that the Coon exists.
They 'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE! THERE 'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE 'RE NOT GON NA HAVE A PARTY! KYYYLE!

It 's time for equality.

Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.

Okay! Take this! Do n't give us that crap! She 's no good to you dead and you know it! Aw aw guys, come on.

South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger.
The only thing he 's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
Like yourself, I am also in the slave trade.
No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno! No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno! No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno! No! No, I 'm not poor and stupid enough to win.
Well I 'm glad you guys all agree.
Life goes by pretty fast.
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You 're always jealous of the Wall-Mart.
And it’s such a tragedy ( feel a bit like dying ).
Wait a minute, that 's it.
Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason! But I do n't have a dad.
Shoot him, Butters! You have to go rescue him! Now I 'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it 's the last time! Okay?! Jimmy, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro! I ca n't let you do that! Fine, Kyle! But it 's not true.
But I do n't have a choice.
No! No, we 're fine! Thank you! What? Mom, she 's lying! Mom, you do n't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina.
Why do poor people always smell like sour milk? I 'm not going back there, man! Well that 's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy 's gon na be pretty wiped out! The fuck?! Who is that?? Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe.

It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony! Do n't you fraternize me! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin 's new television show, via Shitter! You should have taken me out when you had the chance.
Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, but when I computer-enhanced it, You almost got away with it.
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Not go to Mr. Jefferson 's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.

You 're gon na take it, Clyde.
Aaah, kew! Finish her dude, she 's a big fat bitch, she 's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
He has a point.
Drop the 4 and it 's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, but when I computer-enhanced it, You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.

Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew! Ah, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
I ca n't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council 's retarded! I 'm doin ' the best I can! We 're going to the water park, The water park, the water park.
It 's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
How?! Dude, I 'm takin ' a break.
Sister Anne told me that.
Oh! Well, you should n't force your period, Stan.
And all I want in return ... is Grand Theft Auto : Chinatown Wars just ... melted in my hand.
I can laugh again.
Ringy-ding? Aaahh! You sons of bitches! Get back here right now! We 're in a tough economy.
God bless those men that fight for their freedom.
I hope you do it during the entire lunch period.
Stan.

What about my dream?! What about her huge freakin ' hooters, huh?! Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
I love this guy! Wow, a commercial? God, he 's right.
No way.
I 'm a little better than everyone else here.
I have to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us.
Told you guys.
Might as well be us.
Okay, uh, hold it.
It IS N'T OVER!! It is n't over, Kyle! I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts! Yes.
Set phasers on stun.
Prepare for battle! This sounds like a really important quest.
Never mind, because we are going to live! Do you hear me?! You 're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I do n't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a Sega Dreamcast.
I do n't know, dude.
But I wan na sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial! How long is that Chessy Poofs van gon na be outside? As if we care.
But of course you own slaves, because, oh ... riiight.
Hooray! You 're the scientist, jackass! Put them in my laptop! Hold it right there, Kyle! Kill you? Oh no.
What?! Hey, you 're right, Stan.
Let me out of here! Get on the flight! Let 's move move move move! Let 's go to the backyard.
You know, there 's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! We had a deal! Do you think this is funny, God?! Do you mind?! We 're gon na have to go to that hospital where they 're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
Our first album cover.

Better.
Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly 's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh? I 'm sorry, Kyle.
Gentlemen, we have to go! Oh my CHRIST! Kyle? Kyle! We have to go! Oh my God this is so awesome.
This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about `` Greased Lightning.
Ahaha this is certainly funny!! No there are n't.
I, Kyle.
Come on, jagu-ar, let 's see ... The setup could be ... `` Do you like fishsticks? Do you like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, I 'm here.
Bitch, I 'll twist your nuts off! It 's okay, I 'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
Get inside, Butters! I 'm not a sellout! What 's a sellout? Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks.
Hey, that 's it.
Oh, man! And we built it, with our own hands.
Sweet.
Why do n't you mind your own business?! Sir Kyle, they 're about to open the mall! What are you doing?! Sure.
Oh yeah?! I 'll tell you.
But my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents ' bedroom.
They 're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
Oh my gosh, what did you just say?? Ohh my God! Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that? Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it 's gon na be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
I wan na roll with him a hard pair we will be.
Okay, okay.
It 's not fair! It 's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled so I 'm totaly free to use the name, actually.
I 'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
Stop, seriously; you 're killing me all the time.
Let 's just start with something simple.
I admit we are n't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
There 's some killer titties on the loose.
Cartman! Are we on a secure line? Look, I do n't wan na wait for our life to be over ... ''I do n't wan na hurt my bro 's bitch.
Take that! Yeah, you suck, Kenny.
He still looks pretty gay to me.
You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing, man? Dude, you do n't understand.
Look, Kenny and I are mature now.
Oh, yeah, sweet.
We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.
And then I 'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right? The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle.
Come on! So how are things, guys? I 'm afraid I ca n't give you permission.
God-damnit! LET ME OUT OF HMYA! Hey, dudes.
On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet- Wow, look, you guys! Holy crap, you guys! Heheh.
Thanks, everybody.
Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, did n't you hear, Kyle? I measured mine this morning.
Drrrrr.
You 're distracting me! That game show is a fix! Jakov! Open this door! I am Department of Interior guy, and I have a right to know where my friend is!! Hello Kyle!

The cannibals! Do n't you want a Sega Dreamcast? Alright! Kenny 's in, you guys! I mean- Four dollars.
If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it 's funny, Kenny.
Butters, are you enjoying it? What do you want me to do, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! Dowww! Eh! I 'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
Nooooooo! Nooooooo! NOOOOOOO.
I 'm up on this level up here, and all my friends are down here.
Suck my balls! You 've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness.
Wendy.
Will you get off my back?! It 's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know? What 's the matter Kenny? You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want! Oh, you got it?? Oh, for Christ 's sake! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez? Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?! Oh did they? Uh I had n't heard about that.
Yeah! Hey you guys! How? Spooky spider? You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body? So where the hell are we going to hang out with Stan and Kyle, of course.
A rapist is here; he 's white! Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.
Hey, dick-whore.
They what?? Hang on a second : making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy! Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! Home-schooled kids? Who the hell cares?! God, these guys are such dorks! Uh yeah, big dong and prosper.
Oho, man, that totally got me.
Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me.
Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now.
Who did this to you?! Do n't forget I have a signed contract from you.
Now, or soon they 're gon na want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan.
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I 'm so scared! AAAGGGHHH ....
Why are you crying, Chad? Hey, Chad, eh ... You know what you need? You need a friend.
Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound.
Let 's see : each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
God saying that this boy will walk! We are gon na save you and you are gon na walk with the Lord-uh! Devil be gone-uh! Now walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! He walks-uh! Yes! Praise the Lord!

You have KFC! Yes! This is it, Butters.
Okay, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you.
And I am going to lead you there! Well, it looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
Shit! Asshole! 'Scuse me.

All she has to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who 've never heard of Kip.
Okay.
I 've got ta be honest with you, it is n't like terrorism.
You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say `` That 's the bad guy!! Yeah.
Well, Tony, the usual? Why are you crying, Chad? Hey, Chad, eh ... You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
Its coming to me now.
We could meet up later, perhaps? The New Orleans Saints.
Daaaaa! Naaaa! Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa! ... How should I know? I 'm retarded.
The rest are simply there to ... help us get inside those doors.

Yes, well now you can read about all those things I 've said, Butters.
Nuh-uh.
The dream is dead, our land is gone; There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
I 'm sure this is n't the answer.
I 'm not fat! I 'm getting in shape! No they do n't, you 're a friend of Jimmy 's you 're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we grow our rules must change.
Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay! Kyle! Kyle! Get the ... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, I 'm going home.

That 's not cool Butters.
Family Guy is as good as dead! I ca n't let you do that! Fine, Kyle.
Bolo ties are ... really in right now.
Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I do n't see him making a comeback any time soon.
I had a cat.
You are, too! Alright.
Go ahead, Kyle.
But you know, we 've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it has n't been an easy process.
Oh, no.
Um, but, stick with me.
Alright! Now everyone was there.

Yeah, listen, I 'm running a retail business, but I ca n't get enough of people 's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I 'd like to buy some of yours.
It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it wo n't happen again.

Give me back my kidney! It 's MINE! Thank you.
Whatooya mean? Huh?? Eeyy!! His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad?? Oh my God, and you can hear me?? Because, Butters, I 'm totally poor and stupid.
I guess I learned today that sometimes you- Hm.

Hey, what about that? Wow, I knew I would win.
Butters and Scott Malkinson go first.
Just keep stalling, Butters.
I do n't wan na.
Butters, listen! At the vet 's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
What 's that? Oh okay.

Kyle, I swear, if I did n't have a guy 's hand up my ass right now, I 'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts! Ugh.
Can we go? What dude? Sorry.
Alright, so listen : All I want you to do about it.
But now listen up and listen good! I 've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I 'm gon na need every resource this town has! And even if I do n't succeed, and it 's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot.
That 's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! Sit down Mom, we need to have a difficult conversation.
What 's your problem, kid?! What? Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa.
And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony! Do n't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day.
Ah I know you do n't think you 've ... ever been anybody 's friend, but, well, you 're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I sha n't be playing basketball with the likes of you.
You see, we have AIDS.
The fat one! Just like Jared.
Er, just a second, please, Craig.
I just realized something.
I have! But it still was n't enough.
You know what I think, guys? I think we should go through Black Bart 's Cave right away 'cause, we 're gon na get you Wendy.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! '' Aw, screw God.
I 'm sorry, but you 're a little flat.
She did n't take this long to die.
I wonder what it used to be.
We 're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! You 're damn right! One point two inches! I 'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it 's still the smallest in school, but it 's .2 inches bogger than you said!! What? Those were n't our dick sizes? I do n't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! All I 've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he 's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery! Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson 's a little different.
Maybe if you 'd said that to your mom and ... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
Love is like taking a dump, Butters.
Oh, thanks Jimmy Alright Jimmy, see ya.
It 's just not something we do flippantly! There 's protocol! All right, I 'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting.
Wiat.
Alright, guys, here we go.

Come on, now.
Something about a swimsuit - I do n't remember, but you definitely answer `` bad touch.
So let 's go home.

We 've never done that before! '' I brought it up because you already brought it up! Fuck you Kyle! Yes! Nnnn-mo ... Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet! Look at, look at the description.

The Chinese outnumber us a million to one.
Put your manager on! Heh- hello? No, everything 's not all right.
All you got ta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
Heh.
Does n't appear to be handicap-accessible.
Aww man, this smells like meatloaf.
Well, e-yeah, but, there 's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
Kenny! There 's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken for a dollar ninety nine.
They 're having a huge sex party right now and I 'm not invited.
Dude, how long is the wait? Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me new kid.
That 's that 's cool, that 's cool.
Mr. Anderson 's fence and never told him about it.
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you 're just in time.

Wow.

Cooool! Oh wooow! No waaay! It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle 's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!! Hehe heh, heh heh heh.
We 're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle is n't on the computer right now tryin ' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gon na have such a field day, that heartless Jew! Well I wo n't give him the satisfaction! Alright, let 's hear it for Kyle! He 's so funny, is n't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor.
How am I gon na keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?! Butters! Butters! Oh God, it was ... It was horrible! The meteor ... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted.
I 'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day! Kiss my balls, asshole!!! Dude, I totally did n't mean that, Kyle.
Come on, uuhhhgghh yeahhh.
He could do everything.
What? We 're done! No more baseball! All right, we did it! Post-season? Nobody told us if we win too many games we 'd go on to the finals! All right, hit one out of the park! Come on, kid, you got ta at least swing at it.
Yeah, but I did n't get any presents! And what did I tell you, Kyle?! I 'm gon na have to hide out in Russiaaaa! I do toooo! Okaaay.
I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.
No.
Smells like Kenny 's house in here.
... You think I 'm fat and unimportant now?! I AM Eric Cartman! And I 've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin 's new television show, via Shitter! You should have taken me out when you had the chance.
Choppin ' off wee wees is not cool! Dude, yuh-eh-you just do n't ... chop off somebody 's fireman! What the hell is this disgusting crap?! No! No! As a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.
Hunh.
Just think about how famous you 'll be! He used to be my friend! Alright.
Yeah.
And famous.
Kenny, everything turned out okay! Mom, it 's 3:30.
Give me $ 10.
Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
Well, you show me one independent film that is n't about gay cowboys eating pudding.
... I 'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term `` fag, '' Kyle.
Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world ... of cough medicine abuse.
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
Dude, it 's called deodorant, okay? It 's just uh ... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
I take possession of my PSP, sir? Yes! Well ... well then he 's NOT alive.
Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me! But I told you I was sorry.
Okay, okay, lem me, lem me see here.
But since you walked out on the video, you do n't get to come! The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO! Somebody help us! Kyle, hurry! Oh God! Noo nono, I 'm not getting in a pool with Kenny.
God help us.
Can somebody tell my why we 're going to Jim 's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper? What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
Oh my God, Bebe.
Wait.
All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead.
Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, but when I computer-enhanced it, You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom.
There you are, Butters! No, but they 're due home any minute.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves? What the? Oh my God! I 'm a black African American! 'S up, homies? I was just down in the SPC kickin ' it with some G 's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
Now that 's a pirate ship! A fine day o ' plunderin ' we had, boys! What about yourselves? Here you are, lads.
Agh! Gotcha! Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who cares? Kenny 's dead! When do I take possession of my PSP, sir? Yes! Well ... well then he 's NOT alive.
I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka.
God.
Totally.
Shut uh- shut up you guys.
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here! I 'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you! Dude, do n't call me a Canadian! Look, I think I can sign for that! I got a Christmas present! ... Maybe I can see what it is.
Everyone hates us at school and our party 's gon na suck.
Ehey hey, how 's it going? Moving? You ... ca n't leave.
You got some kind of John Travolta disease? Ey! How come you never pick me?! Aww, see? That 's what I was gon na say! That does it! Wait right here! Guys, did you hear that? Butters does n't know how you make semen come out of your body.
I ca n't shoot Token, but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida? The other way to stop the outbreak.
Butters.
I 'm Eric Cartman! Aaah!!! A hundred and six miles, Scott.
This is awesome! Dude! That was so badass! The fuck is this?! Dude! Dude! DUDE! The fuck are you doing?! That 's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he 's a robot from the future just because he 's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That 's right! Stan, if you 're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we 'd like to go now, please? Aw, son of a bitch! You broke Kickstarter! Nobody can! It 's gone! You just could n't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be! Well, somebody did! A merger?! It 's too late for me, Butters.
Joyful all ye nations rise Join the triumph of the skies `` Hark, '' the herald angels sing Yeah, that 's fine.
I do n't think so! Stan, run! What? You 've compromised everything! Our lists ' integrity! It does n't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.
I guess we- ... Oh my God, look at this you guys.
You ca n't win this, guys.
What is the Great Question? I have to get out of here! Aw, crap- Kenny! Bad.
Do you like fucking little boys? Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that 's what you just did with this deal.
Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen? Do n't fuck with me! You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch.
Told you guys.
You go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight! Dude, you ca n't just give up on the world.
Let 's see.
The presentation should begin shortly.
I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.
I must prepare for my next sermon.
Well, believe it friends.
Just a lit- No big deal.
No, it 's not.
Okay, let 's take a vote : Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it 's called menopause? Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that 's why Kyle 's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he 's goin ' through menopause.
We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, but now look at this photo of the Pentagon.
Make me believe in something that 's bullshit, will you?! Oh, here we go.
It 's just like at home! Yup! You know what Hillary says : `` You can suck my clit and balls.
It 's WROOONG! Dude, can I go before you? So ... you do n't like Family Guy either, huh? So what 's your plan? You 're gon na ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air? Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled.
Yeah Token, that 's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
Funny, you do n't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich! Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you do n't have iPads! Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I 'll email some of my friends.
I 'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?! Fine! I 'll do it by myself! You forced me to do this! You could n't just love me as a son.
Do n't worry, they 're not gon na want him to just make one commercial, they 're gon na have to save everyone in this town ourselves! I am saying this because we must be saved-uh.
Yes! There 's a bunch outside my house too.
Oh man, that is hysterical! Oh! This picture I like to call `` The Pierre ''.
Uh, it was a good touch '' or- no wait, you say it was a bad touch.
What the hell are we, the Goonies? Okay, that does it.
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one.
Noooooo! No, God, Nooo! Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants.
Psst real, real quick.
Turn it off dude! Oh yeah, that 's good.
The tobacco companies say there 's no proof that second-hand smoke kills.
How are you? Do n't touch me! Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?! Oh, it 's about freakin ' time you showed up! You do n't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I 'll show you.
I 've got it, you guys.
On my dream.
Let 's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents.
Oh! Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton! Oh man, I ... Stop, seriously; you 're killing me all the time.
I want, you have nothin ' to worry abuot.
I like those, those are cool.
Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear.
Chef.
I 'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they do n't let us take anything back to the cells from here Look, that 's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes? Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes! Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, then I need those cigarettes.
Butters? You 're in big trouble now.
Up.
I 'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?! You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- I 'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?! You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.
He has herpes.
Said.
Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is! We have no choice.
It 's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox.
Help.
Well it 's just that ... that 's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece? Good morning South Park Elementary.
Butters.
What 's up with that? Ahhh, sweet.
What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay? After today they 're gon na be fine, and I 'll never have to see you ever again! No, not with my eyes.
Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner.
Pfaha, so funny.
Oh I get it.
There, that 's better.
I did n't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?! Oh, that 's right.
You got that shit till you die.
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya? Praise the Lord-uh! For he is Lord, he is Lord ... Bring up the next person! This boy has been crippled with sin-uh.
See? Look! I 'm just asking you to lie for me.

Excuse me ... This is the home of Tom Cruise, right? I did n't come for myself.
Noo, let 's save the `` girlfriend is a whore '' line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Sleep! Moooommm! Ms. Lopez wo n't go to sleep! Heyesss.
I 've been asked to give you some really exciting news.
I 'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding! I did not! I wan na close Wall-Mart just as much as you do! Oh it 's sooo easy for you, is n't it, Kyle.
So you all be sure to catch us in our next race.
I talk to you for a second? It 's just ... I do n't know, I guess I 'll take that ring there.
That 's Craig 's house! Aw dude, look, there 's Craig! Heheh.
Mom! God dammit stop ignoring me! This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention! Quit it, mom! Ooo, Colonel? Give, give me the chicken.
Butters, I 'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
Let 's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up! We 're goin ' to see the mall manager.
No! Gross.
What 's he doin ' here? Now how the hell did he do that? Did you hear that, guys? We 're finally gon na die! No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest? What? Yeah, I know what you mean.
I thought we only played on Fridays.
We 're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin ' parents! What the hell is wrong with you people?! Hey, wait, aah! You guys, it 's awesome! Holy shit you guys! You guys, listen to this song I just wrote.
Dear Mom : I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor.
But why? Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I 'm totaly free to use the name, actually.
I promise! Please do n't kill me! Do n't kill me! Doooo ...! No! No! They 're gon na put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take us! Damn his Goddamned authorituh! I do n't wan na.
Nah.
Not now, Mom! We 're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah! All right patrol, you all know the drill.
I can make your head explode with a single thought! Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! What? I 'm afraid that my powers ... are not for sale.
Eeeh! Hey, I did n't get a gun.
I 'm alive! I said I 'm a real person, asswipe! Goddamnit, get me down from here! I 'm not a robot, dumbass! I 'm alive! I said I 'm a real person, asswipe! Goddamnit, get me down from here! You guys, I have to face facts.
You ca n't just `` hit '' a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! Shut you butthole, or I 'll kick your ass! Whaaat?! I do n't care! Clearly I 'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Do n't forget that this was all my idea! Oh, Goddamnit! Let me guess : I 'm in trouble again! For what?! Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?! I do n't smell anything.
Sucky-sucky? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! Meecrob! Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do! My house, too? Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it 's vagina! What a stupid voice.
Aw man, that was sooo awesome! Who cares?? Me?? There 's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle.
All right, come on.
What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies! Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?! I do n't care! I 'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger! Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting.
I 'm better-looking than you! The girls think I 'm better-looking than you, Kyle! Dude, Kyle.
Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you 're XBox people, right? Oh my god they 're so gaaay! Um, kewl.
Kenny? I think he 's smiling you guys.
No, really.
See, that 's a question.
Aw, do n't tell me we have n't even reached the cloud city yet! Alright, look.
If you want me to switch sides, you 'll have to do it tonight.
Butters.
Kyle does n't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous! All right, fine.
What? Tom Saltzman 's dad is a drunk driver.
Wendy.
Aww crap.
That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
It 's sooo cool.
Hey Butters, you got a minute? I 've got ta tell you something, Kyle.
Huh? Not with me, man.
Dude, dude.
I just am.
Oh I like that.
... my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth! .. behind the 9/11 attacks! We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers, which led to their collapse.
But, I need to talk to you.
Oh God-damnit! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! Uh uh come uh, come on, guys.
Tell me who my father is already! Ugh.
Right.
Eh- shut up, you half-Chad! You know? You guys are right.
C-come ohhhn! No Mom, you do n't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time! Then that 's it.
I have super-awesome powers and you do n't.
Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.
I said your dad would be a millionaire.
Okay, let 's take a vote : Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it 's called menopause? Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that 's why Kyle 's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he 's goin ' through menopause.
Let 's give Michael Jordan a call about that.
What 's going on? It 's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
Look, I told you, I had a cat.
Oh-kay.
We 've got the whole summer to play! Stan? Guys? Do n't you notice anything wrong with this picture? Ugh ... Whatever.
I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know.
All right, major stone shield potions should be ... Oh God, I 'm so nervous.
There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! You 're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear! That 's right.
That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me.
Do n't talk to us, kid.
He took it pretty well.
If you all do n't mind, I would like to do my report now.
I understand where you 're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct.
I 'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
Thank you.
Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I 'm gon na make a video blog for my `` Stop Listening To Me '' Web site.
Oh boy, here we go.
He has n't said a word since we brought him here.
Wiffle ball bat, so it 's gon na take a while.
Wait- Uh, what else? Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! Mom! MOOOM! Mom! Seriously! Something wonderful has happened! Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! She 's only given me a lousy quarter before! Yeah! This is so tits! Oh, I mean, this is so cool! Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I 'm goin ' to a better place.
I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life.
Yich.
Sleep! Sleep! Moooommm! Ms. Lopez wo n't go to sleep! Heyesss.
What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay? After today they 're gon na be fine, and I 'll never have to see you ever again! No, not with my eyes.
Hooray! Dude, what the hell? You 're wearing a `` What Would Jesus Do '' bracelet! The big whoop is n't that you have one, the big whoop is that you 're still wearing it! Well do n't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this! Craig?! You asshole! Dude, what 's wrong with the Jumbotron? I think Towelie is awesome.
You said Pete Melman could n't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I 've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die! Jesus Christ! Okay, okay.
Christ! Yeah, he 's excited.
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and ... have you seen the poop swatches.
You know, jus ' ... layin ' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I 'm sayin '? Kyle, this is a private conversation.
What do you wan na do first? Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate you guys!! They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep Who cares?! Throw 'em away!! Heheh, okay, okay.
Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek.
Yeah, you 're gon na take it, Clyde.
Oh my God! One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch! Hey dudes.
Well, looks like nobody 's home.
Cool! Ewww-hoohooo.
That 's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You 'd better watch out, you 'd better not cry— —Christmastime is presents for me.
The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
This cross is seriously heavy.
Mom, you do n't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You 're not the tooth fairy! I 'll see you later! Aw, man, you guys suck.
And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
Sh-gah.
Just sit very still, okay? Here we go.
Uh oh.
Well yeah, dude.
Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky! Aaah! Ten dollar! Ten dollar, soldier boy! Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky! Aaah! Ten dollar! Ten dollar, soldier boy! Gaaah! Heeee! Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.
But I ... but ... Stand back! I ... am going ... to Casa ... Bonita! Ah! Eh.
'what if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park? ' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! Do n't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have one million dollars ... Egh ... Look at it.
And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?! Let 's just see you try and-! Clyde?! The fuck are you talkin ' about, `` quit ''? Huh! I do n't remember that! No, because the aliens erased my memory! Aw dude, I hate repeats! SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! What? Haha, very funny.
That 's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin ' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you 're b-you 're being a dick! Go ahead, Kyle.
No! Must ... fight ... it ... Do n't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, do not come out! If I do n't make it back in time for Christmas I was gon na whup your ass, did n't I?! We 're actually both in my house right now.
Auth- authoritah? Ahem.
Black returns from watching the video.
I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play? Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things.
Mom; I 'm goin ' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! Mom, you do n't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time! Then that 's it.
What?! You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wan na just go back to school, where people just make fun of you? Yes! Do you really wan na go back to that?! Well all right then, fag! We ca n't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK? The FUCK?! 'Scuse me, where are the pirates? Hey, hey we 're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh! Butters, get the phrase book out.
You guys! You guys! Hurry.
No more Salisbury steak and… pecan pie.
We have to lock you away somewhere where even I ca n't get to you! Look! There 's an old refrigerator! Get inside, Butters! I 'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you! Too late for me.
And we 'll have a blast doing the new stuff.
Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight! Fight! Fight! Right now! Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight! Fight! Give him some air.
I appear to be the last of my species alive.
Forty bucks? Alright, alright.
Shut up, Scott Malkinson.
Get away from me! What?! You really think that 's gon na work on me ha ha ha.
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well? Come on, Wing! She 's got a hell of a chin on her, I 'll give her that.
Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to fuck me! Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs.
Endor.
They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat.
Okay, fine, I guess we 'll have to roshambo for it.
It 's trending.
You just got f 'd in the a! Yeah! All right! All right, Butters, I think we 'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
Apparently, only I do.
Kenny? Do you think he 's the savior this town needs or do you think he 's a dangerous vigilante? Kenny? And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? Is he a hero or a menace? While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other ... `` Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right? '' What we all need now- Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.

Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, but when I computer-enhanced it, You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
I said.

That 's all I wanted to say.
You 're wearing the headset and I 'm talking to you as a computer program.
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school.
And they knew one thing : that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it does n't want to.
I did n't know it was you guys.

How about this : Say guys, 1776 was so long ago.
Flame on! Flame off! Come on, Jimmy, we got ta go tell Token I 'm sorry for rippin ' on him for bein ' black.
I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
What does that have to do with me? Kenny has no idea what you 're talking about, fatass! Hrmph! Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival.
You should let it come, like the morning dew.
We 're gon na find out once and for all who had head cooties.

Jews can not play hockey! I 'm not fat! I 'm big-boned! Why the fuck am I here?! Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?! Oh, that 's cool.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters? Even 10 % is good enough.
But we did n't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo.
Come on over this way, Token.
A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin.

In the ... depths of my heart for that long.
Butters- Butters.
